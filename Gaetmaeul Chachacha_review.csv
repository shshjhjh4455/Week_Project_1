2,"Right now, I am obsessed with this drama. Loved every bit of this drama. If you want to watch a good and soothing drama, go for it.I usually hate watching love triangles. But in this drama, they maturely handle the situation. Also, I appreciate the way the actress supported Du-sik the whole time.How can I forget about the side characters? From the youngest Bora to the oldest Miss Gam-RI, I loved everyone. Nowadays, everyone is busy. No one has time to check out their neighbours. I miss the old times.Everyone should watch this."

5,"I look forward to watching every new episode. I feel warm and comforted by the story they are telling. I look forward to spending time with this cast week after week. It is the perfect ensemble cast. The cinematography is gorgeous in the seaside village of Gongjin. Hye-Jin and Du-sik have unbelievable chemistry and when they smile, huge dimples. The whole cast is an extended family and community. This heartwarming story will make you smile and laugh out loud and sometimes bring you to tears. I loved it."
6,"It's so sweet that it saddens my heart to realise that I will never have this kind of love .Nobody will buy me tangerines when I am sick , nobody will eat my porridge even if it's bad , I will have no one to run to if somebody is following me. Nobody will smile at me like chief doesSo I have decided to live this love so sweet through this masterpiece. I hope Kimseon Ho keeps smiling ,he is captivating, teaching kindness wherever he goes and Shinmin-a has never disappointed me, she is exquisite ,you will know if you have seen ""oh my venus"".I don't want this series to end and I want the writers to keep the humour alive , thanku for goodnight dreams,. I think I will never get over this."
7,"I would advise you to ignore the negative reviews here as those people are simply impatient, yes the last few episodes may be have been rushed up a little but still I couldn't stop my tears.This drama really heals you and lets you feel love all over again, brushes up our mind to immerse yourself in living the moment and find ecstasy in everything and everyone around you.You'll learn ll over again how you gotta live your life to it's fullest. Please watch it you won't regret!"
8,"Hometown Cha is an entertaining, charming, feel good story, with a unique plot, interesting characters, and beautiful views of a tiny seaside Korean village. The excellent acting, storyline, and setting, capture your interest from beginning to end.Using flashbacks, meaningful events in characters lives are presented, providing understanding for their sometimes annoying and difficult behavior.The storyline knits together several underlying themes, such as the importance of caring for friends, family, and community, despite past disappointments, and troubles, respect for the hard work of every job, doing the right thing whenever the opportunity arises, working together to overcome obstacles, maintaining dedicated relationships with family, friends, coworkers and community, healing heartbreaks and clarifying misunderstandings. By the end of the story, we feel united with, and appreciate even the initially most unlikable members of this tiny community. We feel an appreciation for small town life, lifelong friendships, and the support the community has for it's members.Three Cheer's to the writers, directors, cameramen and women, editors, and the entire staff. Jobs well done!"
9,"Loved this Korean drama, a complete rouser. Heartwarming, relaxing, funny, emotionally fulfilling ,cute.The characters are really lovable. A voyage to the countryside of South Korea. The music is really nice, I just cannot stop listening the soundtracks."
10,"Every Character in this show is a Kohinoor in itself. Its less about what story it tells, and more about how its told! If you want to just smile, feel good and be happy, go ahead with this drama. Even when you will have a tear in your eye while watching it, the very next moment you will find yourself laughing!!!"
11,Liked it because somehow feeling peaceful after so long since watched Reply 1988. Even watched the 2nd ep twice. Waiting for next.
12,"Short story:- It got me hooked from the very first episode.Long story:- I am someone who have watched plenty of Kdramas in the past and so my standard is pretty high for rating a show as positive. Any show which gets me attached and hooked from early on is straight away deserves 10 stars.Lately at the time of writing there is so much negativity and depressing stuff going on in the world and in our life, i was looking for show which can bring smile on my face after hard day at work. I started few Kdramas on Netflix before this and was struggling to find a decent show.About this show, first of all it is believable, the story I mean. It's so simple yet so beautifully crafted. It's relaxing and doesn't stray away from the story much. The rural setting makes you wanna retire to some place like this in your future. The setting of the town is picturesque and full of colours. Both the lead characters are cute looking and instantly lovable. At times, the show will teach you valuable life lessons also. The romance and chemistry between the two characters are pure and angelic. You know they are made for each other.This is so far my analysis of the show after watching the first few episodes of it. Can't wait how the rest of the story will unfold. So interesting."
13,"Sunday, 17th October 2021Just finished with HOMETOWN CHA-CHA-CHA
.The last 2 episodes were really one heck of an emotional roller-coaster. Undoubtedly one of my most cherished Kdramas ever! Had the perfect balance of Romance, Comedy and Melodrama. Very heartwarming, the characters portrayed in such a way that you'd love to come to visit it every now and then. Indeed the best Rom-Com Kdrama of the yearAnd glad Kim Seon-ho finally had a happy ending!My inner 'Start-Up' rage is now at rest."
14,Shin min a is excellent...the roles r well crafted even for the sides actors..one of the best series I have watched..glued to it since I started watching.
15,"Old fashioned love story
So real natural and with people next door
A closely knit village community.Great performances by these good looking actors
Awesome cinematography and locations."
16,Its refreshing. Hope they make a sequel or something because I want to see them more. (Tho Probably not a good idea to streach it because it ended perfectly)
17,"The beginning, the character development, and the final. And the chemistry between them ahhhhh omg. All of it absolutely perfect. Make more dramas like this plz."
18,"Honestly, I never thought of that I would like this one, since I was never a big fan of romantics. But this one was just that magical, the interactions between the leads were sweet, never too much and natural, all of these made this series more enjoyable."
19,"We've seen a lot of opposite atracts shows, series, and films, but not many of them are drawn up quite so wonderfully and heartfelt as this one. Much of the success of this series has to go to Mina Shin and Seon-Ho Kim with their incredible chemistry.Dr. Yoon (Mina Shin) is a successful dentist who loves living the good life full of fancy clothes, expensive cars, and everything else that goes with high-end living. She makes no apologies for her lifestyle. Perhaps it's because she's really known nothing else.Upon leaving her job, due to conflict with her boss, Yoon leaves for the small seaside town of Gongjin. The last place she felt happy as a child. There, she meets Chief Hong, a man who seems capable of doing literally everything! He works a slew of jobs, all for minimum wage. In short, he enjoys the simple life of service.Of course, at first, these two opposites do not get on very well. Yoon finds herself stranded in the town on her first day without money or even able to get funds due to a power outage. She's soon at the mercy of Chief Hong, who ends up putting her to work pulling the guts out of squid with the local women. You can only imagine how well Yoon is able to adapt.Without a job and a town without a dentist, Dr. Yoon decides to open up a dental clinic. The series is much about Yoon learning to appreciate a different lifestyle that is very different from anything she's ever experienced. This, of course, includes Yoon learning how to be a team player and adapt to the locals as well as the town itself. ""Grandma"" Gam-ri all but steals the show and our hearts.As you can imagine, Yoon and Chief Hong soon become attracted to each other. However, Hong has a dark past that he soon finds is catching up with him. The question becomes: will his past destroy things with Dr. Yoon before they've even started?Dr. Yoon represents those people who can only think about themselves. She comes off initially as fussy and conceited. However, the longer she spends in Gongjin, we see her begin to learn how to love and appreciate others. And Mina Shin has that million dollar smile and those golden dimples to brighten our days with!Chief Hong is a man who is a complete opposite. He thinks mostly of others, even at the expense of himself. In short, he doesn't believe himself to be truly worthy. And he has no idea just how much he's loved and adored by the people of Gongjin.Both are two sides of the same coin. Both have to learn how to adapt. You cannot love others without first loving yourself. And you cannot love others at the expense of yourself either.Of course, as Chief Hong's secret is uncovered, only those who see him for who he is--by his constant example of a man with a good heart--we know that he was not responsible for what happened. Those unable to forgive him are simply cowards who decide that it's easier to play the role of the victim rather than take any responsibility. I was slightly disappointed in Dr. Yoon's reaction to him; that she didn't seem to know him nearly as well as those he's lived with in Gongjin. Everyone else tried to check up on him. She didn't. It's easy to be there for someone when things are good. It's challenging--and even more important--to be there for someone when things are difficult. Also, one should never put pressure on someone to reveal that which they are not ready to tell. Yoon was quite selfish in her demands. Fortunately, she wisely realizes her mistake and tells Chief Hong that he can tell her when he's ready.We get a lot of laugh out loud moments as well as some truly touching ones that are sure to tug at your heart. Koreans are masters of incorporating both elements into their stories. The people of Gongjin will surely warm your heart and perhaps make you even wish that you lived in such a community!All in all, this is a fantastic and delightful series! I loved and adored all sixteen episodes! And it's proof that you can have good and likeable characters still, in world that seems to want to bombard us with dark ones. This show was refreshing like a wonderful day at the beach, which only made me wanting even more!"
20,"What a tv show! I recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece, because it has it all. Drama, romance, plot twist, a good history, good characters and good acting skills. You name it. Definitely one of the best if not the best K-drama tv series of all time. The show has the relatable storyline of humble guy meets rich girl and fall in love."
21,"Like how the romance develops in this drama. For once there is no unnecessary betrayal, evil & despicable people! It's a nice change!They butthead in the beginning but without her knowledge, he has already attracted & fall in love with her! She changed because of him, the town & its people! Great influence! They have a beautiful chemistry together!Not in favour of the leading actress/Hye-Jin in the beginning, she is snobbish & conceited though kind-hearted. Her bestfriend is so understanding! Even her found her soul mate who is sweet, kind & a little dense!I-jun the 9 year old is so cute, respectful, sweet & is a Saint! The girl Bo-ra is also adorable!Felt so sad for the demise of Ms Gam-ri, she is definitely the heart of the town & her 2 bestfriends! It's so nice to see the leading actor/Du-Sik ends up being good friend with Seong-Hyun, who is actually his rival! It's even nice Hye-jin gets along with her step-mom!What a wonderful external family in that town of Gongjin!Perfect ending! Worth watching!Might binge watch again!"
22,"It makes you wanna fall in love, live, have lots of food with friends. Even during the sad scenes it makes you feel calm. I find it absolutely beautiful!"
23,"If you need to see something to make you feel good, you're in the right place. This isn't my first ""healing k-drama"" but definitely is one of my favorites. I loved the chemistry between the actors, how the story was told, how it was filmed... Every detail was made with love and to make you fall in love with the story and their characters. I recommend this in 100%."
24,I love it why can't they do 5 a week - so disappointed to have caught up with the live releases. The bad guys get caught and get what they deserve. We still don't know the answers to the 3 mysteries!! Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah make a beautiful couple lets hope the story ends happily.All of the other supporting characters have really strong parts and they are great fun to watch. So many beautiful people and the filming is wonderfully done.I love the little bit at the end where we learn a little secret about one of the incidents we see in that weeks episode. Finally the theme music is a joy.. I only wish I understood Korean however the English subtitles are well written and make it very easy to understand the humour and the frustration.Praying that there are more seasons and many more episodes.
25,"Having seen a number of K dramas, you begin to notice that there a certain premises that appear frequently. This drama has the new girl who loses her comfortable life and begins an unfamiliar life in a rural town. While I've seen this premise many times, each drama was be uniquely different based on the location, characters. Storyline and most of all the chemistry of the lead characters.So far, I'm only two episodes in and I'm loving this one already. The scenery is beautiful. I recognize most of the supporting cast who portray the close knit, supportive and colorful community. The leads have an opposites attract thing going on that is more respectful than antagonistic, which I find refreshing.Often, you will see dramas take a stereotypical moment and put a new spin on it. Just wait until you see who gets the piggyback ride in this one and have it melt your heart. So far, there's been so many heart-warming moments and it's just getting started. This light and breezy drama was just what I was looking for."
26,"Feel good series.Best Korean series I have ever watched.You will cry smile.Became happy sad
You will be emotional towards the end.I felt like why this series ended within just 16 episodes and why not series goes on forever.I became a part of the town..need to visit that places at least once."
27,"So fun to see a fresh original show that shines with love and heart. You love the town characters, the grannies, the kids, the relationships and the quaint seaside town. Great script and actors made us want to return night after night for more. Maybe a sequel?"
28,"If you are feeling low or if you are bored, just watch it you won't regret. Peaceful plot, great ethics, cute love story."
29,"Loved the English dubbing, voices and best translation. Episodes 13-16 were the best of any series I have watched ever! So much h emotion, honesty and so timely. BRAVO! Cannot stop watching Korean series/movies. Just finished watching another fantastic series, Navillera. A must to view also."
30,"After watching and finishing all episodes of Extraordinary Attorney Woo, I started flipping through Korean tv/movie shows. This caught my attention because of the catchy title and decided to start watching it. I loved it...still watching it and can't stop. I looked at the info and it's only Season 1 , I really hope they renew and have a season 2 or more. The show is so good and refreshing. The love team is adorable, they are perfect for each other!"
31,"This is a fun thoughtful rom com. It deals with the baggage we carry from big or little events, but it always keeps a light touch, or at least returns to a light touch quickly. It is such a loving look at Gongjin (Pohang) look like such paradise.I've thing I have to discuss is how sooo many of the actors listed as being in this K-Drama are incorrect. There is one role listed twice, the role of Yeo Hwa-Jung. The actress that played her, Lee Bong-Ryun, is listed, but so is someone that was not even in the cast. There are others that are completely incorrect also. If you want to know who is in the cast, look up the entry in Wikipedia."
32,"This drama story seems simple but give some nice twist on every episode. Humble story, nice story telling but give lots of message in life."
33,"Unlike Hometown Cha Cha Cha's original source material Mr. Handy (2004)- a film that was riddled with erratic pacing, impassive sound design, underdeveloped characters and sexual assault tropes that absolve men and their crimes, on paper, this TVN adaptation sounds like a recipe for disaster. How is it possible for such a mediocre at best film in the 2000s to be adapted into a mini-series that remains both faithful to its source material yet at the same time creates so much more depth and nuance to its characters and story that in turn makes Mr. Handy look like the adaptation instead?The series begins on a similar trajectory as with the film- Yoon Hye-jin is a dentist in Seoul who quits her high paying dream job to start her own dental practice in Gongjin- a seaside town 3 hours away from the capital with no dental clinic of its own. There, her path coincides with an unemployed jack of all trades man Hong Du-sik (also known by everyone in town as Chief Hong) who challenges Hye-jin on her Seoulite attitudes and prejudice against the working class villagers.Yoon Hye-jin is a character that is written in an unusually unapologetic way for a South Korean drama female lead. She is a judgemental perfectionist with a high moral and ethical compass whilst also being an emotionally compulsive shopaholic, a monthly donator across various charities and a black out drunk. Her view of success in life revolves around the confines of having an apartment by the Han River, a prestigious education, a high-income paying job and the idea that meritocracy is not a myth. The complexities and contradictions of this character can become easily unlikeable and annoying depending on the pacing and the actress cast. Thankfully, Shin Mi-na portrayed each points of Hye-jin with layered nuances that made her relateable on her struggles in adjusting to village life but also at her protestations of the outdated views that still circulate in Gongjin.As the male lead, Hong Du-sik is a character that is seemingly written as Mr. Perfect whose happy go lucky attitude armed with his plethora of different work licences for his oddball jobs (and accepting only minimum wage) make him the go-to townsperson for everything they need help with. He surfs, cooks, crochets, fixes cars, reads Henry David Thoreau, owns a Leica IIIf, wears flannel shirts and even has a fruit plating license. He sounds about as unrealistic and pretentious as you can get with a hipster male lead; but due to the Shin Ha-eun's writing and Kim Seon-ho's modest acting, the end result is actually a subverted take on conventional hetero-masculinity that is rarely seen not just in South Korean shows but frankly everywhere.Labelled as a romantic comedy, I would actually say this is perhaps purely for marketing purposes to stage this show as a light hearted love story between two characters when really, it is a story about the lives of people who live in Gongjin and about overcoming grief. Yes, the leads are Yoon Hye-jin and Hong Du-sik, however the leads on average only take up about half the screen time each episode as the rest is divided and devoted to the supporting ensemble cast. The supporting characters do not exist in the story to serve the purpose of bringing the two leads together- in fact a lot of their problems do not relate to the leads at all, however, the realistic and often brutal and ugly at times dialogue that writer Ha-eun writes for each character gives us the sense that this picturesque idyllic town has its own problems just like Hye-jin and their stories are just as important as hers.When you compare Hometown Cha Cha Cha to Mr. Handy, the former keeps all the skeletal details of the latter and in addition, fleshes out all the unresolved and underdeveloped tensions in the storyline. Time is given for the cinematography to establish Gongjin as a character in itself alongside the cast. The acoustic guitar riffs between each episode set the tone of a rom-com but it also noticeably shifts to sombre piano notes as the series takes a melancholic shift in the latter part of the show. Whilst the show's ending can be said by some to be too ideally optimistic, the journey that these characters take to end up where they are is painful, harrowing, hilarious and bittersweet."
34,"I have seen many Kdramas but this has got to be my new favorite! The setting of a dentist going to open a clinic in a small country city is cliche but works. The nosy but fun neighbours you grow up on. I didn't think I'd like all of them, but did, especially the there old ladies! The sea side and views are amazing. I loved Hye-Jin and her groth to love Gongjin (as did I). The chemistry between her and Chief Hong was amazing, and loved how they were the opposite sides that fell in love with each other.My only complain would be the Du-sik drama that was painful to watch (looking at you episode 14&15) because i loved him so. His past could have been less painful but, even so, they did do it well. Hye-jin was the one he could open up and be his rock. The part where he told the story to Hye-jin was my favorite also.Overall, a must watch, cheerful and sometimes cheesy drama. I laughed and cried a lot. But you will fall in love with it and love every second."
35,K drama-decent acting all=even the3 old ladies r superb=its funny/sad/etc just hope get the ending well ending i want--and Shin Min-a is not just a grt actress but she is beautiful too.
36,"This is only the 2nd Korean Netflix Series I have ever seen. I noticed the main male actor in the leading role Kim Seon-ho in the previous Start-Up series and had to search and find more which led me to Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha. It turned out to be one of the cutest Romantic comedies - I just loved how it is so innocent, sweet, lovable with a sense of humor. The leading actor Kim Seon-ho is the perfect person to play this role - you just can't stop watching it. You are laughing one moment, and crying the next. I love how all age generations are portrayed in the sea-town - the older generation giving wisdom and I love learning more about the Korean culture. I am not sure how true to life any of this culture is since I have no previous experience watching these type of series, but if even an ounce of it is true that is so wonderful."
37,"The storyline is simple and predictable. If you expect something dramatic, this is not for you. All that matter in this drama is the dialogue and interaction among the characters. Although it is not all realistic, their natural acting makes this drama so healing and heartwarming. I highly recommend it to someone who wants a break from complex dramas/ world."
38,"This was my third k-drama watch, it was recommended to me from a friend. After the first two episodes I wasn't completely sold, but persevered through 16 episodes.I fell in love with all the characters, the longer episodes allows for in-depth character development and I related to an aspect of each and every one of them. The honest and fiery connection with Hye-jin and Du-sik was charming and a joy to watch. The story is not your average good guy/bad guy plot, so I never felt overwhelmed by the scenes. When watching other shows that are thrillers/crime/suspense I have felt anxious and uneasy, that why I really enjoy these romantic stories with a twist. It was heartwarming and the ending was a beautiful conclusion to all the characters stories. Highly recommend you to watch if you enjoy a slow story with character development and brilliant acting."
39,Keeps you engaged all the time. Very well written and actors have done an amazing job. They've absorbed the character so much which makes it natural. Quite lengthy episodes but definitely worth watching it.
40,I miss watching Min-A on a kdrama and this series did not disappoint. I did not expect i will like it and after watching this i became a fan of Seon-ho too. This series is fun and kept me interested every episode until its done.
41,"Truly, this is my favorite show. It truly aspires me to be better than I am. This show makes me want to love and help others, and that's something the world desperately needs. <3."
42,"This story is just so nice. The whole cast is good and has a role into making it funny, interesting and lovely. I don't think it is predictable, it has original elements well developed and the romance is not the entire focus."
43,"What seems like a simple narrative actually delves into many facets of human relationships - how strangers become allies, friends, even family. There are no ""villains"" but there are secrets, heartaches, even trauma. OST is the LSS-type, scenes are postcard perfect, and the characters are quirky, warm, and genuine. It is a worthwhile drive to go visit and linger in Gongjin any time of the year."
44,"This drama is a perfect break from EVERYTHING.It makes you go back to what really happens in REALITY, and give you break from all fantasy, suspense and thrilling scenes. Though the settings and the flow of the story is simple, there are parts that are still unpredictable. It perfectly REFLECTS LIFE that there are things that we can expect and things that come to us unexpectedly. That simplicity is what makes it more HEALING.I somehow relate with the male lead character, because there are really some moments in life where you just want to escape, and find a home that will comfort you. And I really wish to find my own Gongjin!The actors acting skills is a BIG BONUSSS! Great job to the whole cast and production team! Thank you for reminding me that there is beauty and genuine happiness in SIMPLICITY in these hard times! :)"
45,Wow Homcha was the only K-drama that hard to move on. I don't know how many times I rewatch it until I remembered the lines. It was actually an ordinary life that we miss so much in this never ending pandemic T^T and it heartwarming story will touch your soul..
46,"Hometown Cha Cha Cha is a healing rom-com drama. Never get bored with the drama. The plot, the scenery, the scripts and the casts of the drama really did well on potraying the drama well. Congrats Homcha."
47,Watch and replay many times and never get bored about story. It is like daily story that happen to all of us. Love kim seon ho and shin min ah and other actor and actress supporting this movie.
48,"This drama appeared at the exact right time. With the pandemic still going on, I was starting to lose hope. Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha reminded me of the precious human connections that we need in order to make life meaningful and enjoyable, coupled with the amazing cinematography and the beauty of their filming location.Each and every actor gave a brilliant performance, from the youngest kid to the oldest grandma. The main leads have oozing chemistry, anyone would have fallen for either one (or both) by the end of the drama. I would give anything to be able to watch this drama again for the first time. Until that happens, I'll just keep rewatching it."
49,"I didn't have any expectations when I first watched this.I thought just to pass the time. But little that I know, I fell in love with this drama wholly.The story is light and so relatable. The characters are not typical Korean drama characters. The love story is beautiful. Both characters gave positive impacts towards each other.I love the cinematography.I love how the neighbors are fussy but kind...
I love the morals and life advises they delivered.Kim Seon Ho and Shin Min Ah played the characters very well, with their bickerings as strangers, friends and lovely bickerings, then their lovey dovey acts... Their actings are natural and sincere, masterclass actings.I love the closures of this drama, and how everyone live happily together, with a note that a typhoon may come, but it is okay as long as they are together.I would suggest this drama to everyone I know, for it is a healing drama, especially during this pandemic era."

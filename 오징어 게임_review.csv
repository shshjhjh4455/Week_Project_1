0,So many twists and turns this show keeps you guessing every episode! It's an amazing show all the way through. Definitely deserves it's spot amongst the Netflix top 10.
1,Really cared about these characters. It really made me attached to this movie. Great storytelling!
2,Hope find season two and dad Sang Woo actor who sweetheart as mean characters . Go hun will fight evil guy offers him in danger play in games if Squid Game. Make girl's brother and Gi hun's daughter had met each other. Upset Sangwoo killed off.
3,"This series is beautifully produced and directed. So many stories with in itself and has drama, action, suspence. I couldn't stop watching it. I hope they do a second season, or add more episodes.Beware parents not for children, lots of death, gore, blood, simulated dead bodies, violence."
4,"Everyone talking about it, So I just wanted to try one episode. But I finished just one night. I could not sleep. I think this is best Netflix show ever."
5,I like it so so much ... It was the first to end in first day ... But i think there will be season 2 bcs its not completed ... I hope its near bcs i can't wait.
6,"This would get an 11 if I had that option. Just when you think there is little inventory on new concepts, this series pops up and is beyond unique and thought provoking. I can't wait for the second season. An absolute masterpiece. The reviewers who think it's all about killing people miss the point entirely."
7,I really enjoy every second of this TV show it's so perfect and amazing it deserves 10 out of 10.
8,"The Netflix subscription is $9 but the therapy you'll need after this show is priceless.To sum it up as briefly as possible, it's like a sundae made of scoops of Shawshank Redemption, The Purge, and the first Saw movie, with a little bit of Star Wars sprinkled on top."
9,"Absolutely brilliant! Loved it from start to finish, excellent acting (apart from the American actors at the end! Dreadful) Great story, had me hooked.. binged watched the lot!Looks like they'll be a second series which I can't wait to see! Superb."
10,"The peer pressure made me watch this. I wish this show came out about 10 years ago as some small part was predictable but was I surprised? Oh boy,I definitely was. Don't need a second season, but praise the creator and let him make more shows and movies. This was brilliant!"
11,"Had me gripped from the beginning to the end.Some plot lines were signposted v obviously but it was still edge of your seat viewing. I love an open end that leaves you imagining your own conclusions. Well acted, good character development, heart breaking and whilst not entirely original it had enough going for it to make it stand out."
12,"This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films."
13,"The first episode is so packed and dense with brilliance that even though it's only a hour long it felt like a full complete movie in and of itself, yet I was unable to look away the entire time it was that good."
14,"One of the best series ive ever watched,i hope it gets renewed for second season."
15,The series is so good and so emotional it is itself the first series i watched in korean. Highly recommended!
16,"Loved every minute, couldn't stop watching!They did a great job in making it feel more ""realistic"" and not like SAW or some other classic horror/thriller movie."
17,"One of the amazing series I have ever watched, day after day the Korean drama proves to be the best. If you are feeling bored because of repetitive ideas of Hollywood drama just watch Squid Game, the idea is just fresh in the packet, the actors are very capable, even the music is perfect. You can't just simply ignore the next episode, it is like addiction you will continue to watchðŸ¤—"
18,I really enjoyed it and suggest this series to everyone I know! Perfect.
19,"Wow, I cannot believe this show! Ending was a bit
????? But overall excellent great work Netflix."
20,"Just completed the series and found this show so thought provoking for many reasons. You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters. The premise of the show is simple on the surface, but it much more complex the deeper you get into it.This show also brings a disturbing realization to me in real life:
I mentioned the show to my daughter who is in her first year of teaching kindergarten. She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of. What a warm and fuzzy thought!"
21,One of the best shows I've watched! Everyone of the actors was so so good.
22,Been waiting for such a show with that much suspense.I loved movies that had similar storylines like Would you Rather & Saw.This is the cream of the crop.I am waiting for the sequel. I would hope for the games to be more complex though.
23,Nothing else to say but wow. This show had me on edge of my seat for 9 hours. Like a cross of Hunger Games x The Purge and Would You Rather. If you like thriller/suspense this show is for you.
24,"It is disturbing in a way that why the hell is happening this ?But I have to say that the plot is unique ( Not in a good way or bad way but very dark grey i guess ).Okay, At last my opinion is one should watch this."
25,One of the best kdramas ever. I will dÃ©fini rewatch t many times.
26,Best evee but in SEASON 2 I HOPE SUNBYOUK CAN BE BACK WHAT EVER HAPPEN I DON'T CARE BECAUSE SHE WON ALL FANS HEART AND ALI NO.199 TOO.
27,"I saw this before the hype train departed the station and I was hooked from the very first episode. My only gripe was some of the characters voices from the dubbed version when I watched it the first time round. Gi-Hun's voice was very dopey in the dubbed version and Mi-Nyeo's voice was so screechy and irritating her character was almost unbelievable.On the flip side of that, I've just finished watching it in Korean with subtitles and it changed the whole thing for me. It makes it much more serious, 'believable' and gripping than the dubbed version.Its not going to blow your mind or change your world, but it's simplicity, gripping storyline, thought provoking nature and brutality is where it's attractive. It's definitely worth a watch."
28,"Culminated Visually examining Famous Korean Web series #SquidGame What a great Series Absolutely Doted This. It tells the story of people who have Their Quandaries And how they fight to dispense it. It tells us about the value of mazuma and to what caliber can a man go to procure it. It shows us that their are no authentic friends, affinities when it comes to your own survival. We all find ways to push every obstruction that comes in our way. It's about apostasy , Obsession and hunger of acquiring victory.Overall this series was great filled with human emotions, our day to day quandaries. Their are some genuinely fascinating games that one plays to earn mazuma. It tells us the consequentiality of mazuma and Expounds the Law of marginal Utility. It shows us our lives have become vapid by this conventional routine. We require to Keep the child inside us alive. Background score Music everything was Superb integrating intensity to scenes. Episode 6 was too good and emotional. Season 2 Is Coming Can't Wait. The Short Comeo of Gong Yoo Was treat to visually examine. Must Watch, You'll dote it."
29,"""Squid Game"" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what's to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won't be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore."
30,"Squid Games realisesThat even closest ppl will ditch/kill , when they want to become billioner or go ahead from you in life/career .Billioner thinks common man are like horse to whom we can do gambling & make ""FUN"" by using them .Many ppl will do buttering/use you when they need something , but same ppl will throw you OUT they have same power in thier hands."
31,"Netflix has given a solid blockbuster with this series. Starting from the concept upto the execution, everything is perfect and all actors performed brilliantly. A must watch."
32,One of the best shows I have seen in a long time. Highly recommend watching it if you don't mind watching in Korean. The English dub isn't as good as the Korean version so I recommend you watch with English subtitles. Brilliant acting throughout.
33,"This series has made me cry twice, a 33-year old male. I can't but give it a 10. Please go explore the capacity of human soul to feel more. After all, American cinema has failed at that a long time ago."
34,"Held in suspense throughout, a furious desire to click on ""next episode"" as soon as it ends ... The atmosphere totally shifted between the cruelty of the games and the aesthetics of the naive and childish colored sets, as well as the very soundtrack. Focused on classical music while acts of a nameless barbarism take place before our eyes... To watch in original version even if we do not understand anything in Korean so as not to miss the great actingThe ending foreshadows a season 2 while being relatively surprising as to the identity of the creator of the game. A few small questions remain, but nothing important enough to be disturbing.A great discovery that I recommend without hesitation if the big spurts of blood don't bother you too much."
35,"I have just finished it watching and I have no words to describe it. Trust me when I say this , It is probably the best thing I have ever seen. Story, acting , casting , production everything is very apt and top notch. I can't believe how perfect of a show is this. It is extreme in every human nature they portrayed like when they want to show you hate , friendship, trust , action, backstabbing every emotion is of very extreme kind. It also teaches us that money is not everything. Those who have money and those who don't are sad in one way or the other & We should help others no matter what. I will give it 10 out 10. All hail to Korea for this treat. Love from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³"
36,"Sure, it's a complete rip-off of a Japanese classic movie but it's still one of the most imaginative and visually stunning shows this year.Love it.Watch it!"
37,"What a beautiful surprise we got here, Netflix usually makes cheap content, like in budget and in creativity, but this is one of the few great things Netflix release per year, like The OA or La casa de papel, Ozark etc.The quality of the script is top pitch perfect, as the characters construction, absolutely great games, very unpredictable, and the teams are more like a chess game, it doesn't matter if u have the strongest team in a tug of war, if u have a genius, an old wise man, fearless integrants, you can rock the way out of any situation, this show grew on me, I LOVED IT."
38,Its been a while since the last time time stopped while watching a series. A long waited time.
39,"I have never seen a ""last man standing gets the money"" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them. Would I be a part of Squid Game? Definitely not. I have too much to lose. Beautiful, yet sobering series."
40,"Netflix always grabs bang on shows, and this one is another level i watched earlier but shoked yet and thinking about the series....
Fun fact:- The director struggled for almost 10 years to publish this drama...."
41,Netflix always grab the bang on shows. This one is at another level.Fun fact:- The director struggled for almost 10yrs to publish this drama....
42,Nothing short of perfection. Lee Jung Jae is sensational. A lot of thought into this season here's hoping for a season 2 . Love it. Characters development is perfect.
43,"I dont know how it happend, but a couple of days ago i was memorising my childhood (thats not happening a lot). And then i had a strong memory about this childhood game we used to play as kids in the neighborhood. And guess what? That game was the 1st game those players in this tv show played (i dont remember its name in a foreign language), the one they needed to freeze after the count stop... So i was realy amazed by finding this great tv show. Its seriously shown how our mind worked as kids and how we been more active as kids- as shown Through all the games in this amazing tv show. So yes its a big 10/10 for me.Recommended to any human being on this earth."
44,"I've personally found the majority of Netflix's original content to be mediocre or uninteresting. Stranger Things was the last series that left a big impression on me (at least the first season lol). Now Squid Game's done it.A+ storytelling, character development, cinematography, set design, costume design, acting, writing, editing. It was so well done. I was pulled in from the start and invested in it as though it was all real. It's top tier entertainment, and it should be no surprise to anyone because of how well it's doing in both the US and the rest of the world. If it were as bad as other reviews might say, it wouldn't be getting so much social media buzz and definitely wouldn't be closing in as the most streamed Netflix series of all time. It's just that good. Not to discredit more critical reviews, but they're subjective. Nothings ever for everyone. But Squid Game has proven to be for most with its huge popularity.The credit for this show is the director/writer. He's a genius and had a lot of weight on him with making this, and I'm so glad Netflix picked his idea up after a decade of not finding anyone to help make this show. I watched this with my friend, and I'll be watching again with my family if they decide to see it too.I watched the Korean audio with English subtitles, and from what I've been seeing online, that's been the best way to watch it. It started playing automatically in English dub, and my friend and I were like ""ehhh no"" when we heard it. So glad we changed it.I can't wait to see a second season."
45,Every episode they took morea than anything efforts to make such a great show. I love this show and all the characters made this show a very well. Congratulations to all the cast and crew for working for this series. Loved it and i can watch it again and again.
46,"Just watch it
I watch a million TV shows & movies
And I shoud say this is one of my best experiences."
47,Fantastic show. Hoping there will be a season 2. Really entertaining we were very roped in the whole time! Emotional at times. Check it out!!
48,Superb series mind-blowing suspense thriller novel drama all mixed.
49,"Take Battle Royale, Alice in Borderland, and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji - put them in a blender with all the best parts of each - BOOM you get Squid Game. Incredible plot, great acting (yea the English VIPs were awful, but not enough to the people who are complaining about them in reviews), and the intensity...wonderful series."

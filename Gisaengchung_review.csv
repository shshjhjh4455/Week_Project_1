0,Fantastic gtreatest movie. Win the best motion picture award really.
1,"What a great movie, bravo.. bong direct this movie up to the mark. fantastic"
2,That's it. That's all I'm writing about this film. Now go watch it if you haven't already.
3,"Good movie to watch when u are boring
Really recommended!!"
4,This movie had me terrified the entire time which is incredibly rare. Easy 10. I've never experienced something like this.
5,"When you write a review this late into a movie's life, post-genre busting Oscar, nobody will read this stuff, so here goes nothing.
I've always liked the con men / grifter genre because it's all about the glorious world of deceit, where nothing is as it seems. Typically the drama comes when the best laid plan falls apart, which it does so gloriously and tragically here.
I'm looking forward to the black and white version, as there's a glorious luminosity to that format, and this picture really doesn't require color."
6,"Man, where do I even begin? Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far.And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it."
7,"It is pulling you into reality and at the same time to the illusion.
Showing both side and connecting them well.
Spectacular ending.
Congrats!"
8,"Saw Parasite yesterday. Something that we missed out during MAMI. What a brilliant gripping tale this is! It is a class-conscious thriller that you wouldn't want to miss.To start with, it makes you laugh with its comic rendering. When you see the entire movie it defies all your expectations along the line. Bong Joon-ho crafts an intricate look at modern-day social hierarchies. He keeps you flipped on one mood then drastically changes it to the other while delivering some brilliant thematic elements. When you spend 132 minutes seeing this movie you encounter and experience: clever, humorous, dramatic and every other kind of emotion.It is also a hilarious and irreverent take on South Korea's class warfare. I cannot overstate how refreshing Parasite is both as a genius piece of arthouse cinema, but also a very contemporary comedy of errors. Parasite is so sublime because it can be watched for pure entertainment value of a sly poor family manipulating gullible elites into paying them for various services, but Parasite also wades in deep waters of sympathy for its poor desperate souls.It is an outstanding South Korean dark comedy that will stand up to the ages. Its final moments are so unsettling, and so unforgettable and impossible to estimate. It is a test that you undergo yourself and you're most likely to fail! 😊"
9,"Bong Jon Hoo has created a masterpiece; Parasite hits every genre throughout the film from thriller, horror, comedy & mystery just to name a few. You never know what's going to come next & it had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish. I recommend watching the B&W version as it gives a different experience. One of my favorite films of all time, can't recommend this film enough; no wonder it's claimed every prize in the industry, throughly deserved!"
10,"I can't get over how it ended, everything comes at a cost every decision has its consequence. It's dark realistic thrilling and sometimes funny. This fits to many different genres."
11,"I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!"
12,"So, you think you're going to ""fast track"" your way to the good life huh? By taking a short cut here, a little lying and deceiving there.Well maybe.. it seems to work for some, why not for you? (I mean how else did they get there, right? By being honest? ..oh please!)So you decide to take the ""easy"" road. One lie opens one door, then another, and yet another.Things seem to be going so well for you. You're getting ahead without having to make any real sacrifices. All of this unearned wealth is just within your reach.
But one night...~~~~~LIGHTNING! ~~~ THUNDER! ~~~~~...comes a flood.And the entire foundation your life is built on, washes away.Turns out all those lies, short cuts, and easy way outs were not good building material.You had the wrong plan. You walked the wrong path. And you made the wrong sacrifices.You thought you were taking the easy way out, the short cut.Look at how wrong you were.In the end, you lost everything: Your sister. Your father. Your home. Your freedom. Your health.Tell me again how this was suppose to be the easy way out?My god... would it not have been easier to have made the proper sacrifices right from the start?I guess we all have to learn are lessons somehow.So today I have a new plan. I will go to university, study, graduate. I will get a job and work very hard. I will become rich. And I will get back the house. And one day, you will walk out of the basement father, and we all be reunited in the sunshine of the courtyard.Until then."
13,"So just lemme give a short review about points that make Parasite the best movie of the year or maybe the century:1- It's a literal Dark Comedy movie although it discusses a non sensitive concept that's actually thrown every where on media2- the economic gab wasn't about the evil rich or the fighting poors and has nothing with specific country u politics/economy3- the balance between reality and fiction that makes ur mind wonder instead of watching the same senario4- ""best plans are those never existed""5-no one of the poor blamed anyone for being like that or even wondered what if6- the end show the human's priority for 'survival'"
14,"Truly, something to remember. Thank god we have good film makers left. Everything in place. I Only hated that I could not undertand language, liked to think that I picked something on the way."
15,"Parasite was awesome. From the screenwriting to the acting, this was a film. This was a beautiful film. From the twist and turns it makes, to the surprise ending. Parasite had it all. I wish I was able to have seen it sooner but no theaters near me were playing it. But it's ok because I watched it and loved every second of it. The world this movie brings together, between wealthy and poor. This was a beautifully shot film and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. I don't want to talk too much about the film because I don't want to spoil it, so please. Go see Parasite, you will not regret it."
16,"I really loved this movie, you should also at least give it a try."
17,This isn't a feel-good movie. It is is the cold harsh reality of whatever the movie's message was. I was too grasped on the story itself to see the bigger picture. That could be the message itself. It really took my perspective of life and twisted it.
18,"Outstanding balance between arthouse and mainstream. Solid acting, impressive direction, beautiful shooting, intense narration, unconvetional humor and story development. Brilliant."
19,"If you are hesitant to watch it because of the subtitles, don't be. This is a phenomenal movie which literally deserves it's own genre. It's intense, gritty yet subtle like- rollercoaster inside of a maze- type journey will leave you speechless at the end of this masterpiece."
20,"Best movie i've ever seen in decade, everything is so brilliant"
21,"Cinematic Masterpiece with a mixed genre. A film that will hold you up and never bore you not even for a second. Its storyline, drastic drama which leaps up the story. Its an tecnical masterpiece cause Boon jong ho knows what he is doing and he crafted it well.
If you asked is it the movie of the decade?
Well, i can't tell it but it will be in the list.
Haooy watch."
22,"Bit of a mazza throughout cannot lie. Mazza at the start, big mazza middle, mega mazza end. Overall, top mazza"
23,"To be honest, normally, I do not fancy such type of movies, especially asian movies, this one, well, it nearly kills you. It starts somehow slow, even boring, maybe a touch of comedy, but then, then the second half of it is just a nightmare focusing on society and it's negative aspects. This movie kept me awake for many hours at night and will always remind me of so many things like to be thankful for what you have and how to approach others. Check out yourself. For sure, one of the true oscar winners! Fully deserved!"
24,"First off, I feel like you either get this movie or you don't, that simple. There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play, those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story. I don't want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days."
25,"Fantastic movie, I really liked it. History, script, actors, it was really a very good work."
26,"This movie has it all. Great script, outstanding acting, the drama, the comedy, the thrill, the cinematography and an amazing director. Incredible movie."
27,"This is true masterpiece
It's unpredictable i love this movie"
28,"Top 10 movie of all time. The movie is hilarious and tense. There are no short cuts in life. Actions have consequences. And, family is really all one has in the end."
29,"In my latest IMDb review, I wrote the following;""1917 is British director Sam Mendes' latest opus. I also believe that it is the next Best Picture, and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing.""Don't get me wrong, 1917 is a splendid and absorbing war movie. But after watching Parasite, I no longer agree with my earlier statements regarding Oscar statuettes ...Parasite is perhaps one of the most unique films I have ever seen. One second, it is a hilarious comedy, and in the other, a terrifying horror flick. Suddently, it turns into a romance and then you find yourself watching a jaw-dropping thriller. The greatest thing about it, is that you don't even notice these dynamic changes in genre. The natural flow of the movie is just so beautiful.I don't even know how Joon-ho was able to craft such a film as Parasite. No single shot is wasted, the intelligent script is baffling and sometimes the characters feel even more alive than real people.Some complain over the fact that the film is in Korean, and that you end up reading the subtitles more than watching the actual movie. I find that statement to be nonsense. Maybe it is because I am quite used to reading subtitles that I find it to be so (I am from Sweden), but perhaps also because the acting is just so good that you know the feelings of each character just by looking at their facial expressions.To conclude, I wish for Parasite to win five out of six possible nominations at the Academy Awards tonight;Best picture:

South KoreaI believe that Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood had better sets, but in all honesty, what is it compared to Parasite ?I would not hesitate to put it in my top 10 best movies which I have ever seen. And, it is probably, the greatest movie of the 2010's. Read no further about it, just watch it. You will be delighted.10/10"
30,This movie is damn ...#masterpiece#fun#darkcomedy#oneofthebestmovie# ........such a different concept 💡 ✨ 😍
31,"I saw Joker, The Irishman, Ford V Ferrari, Jojo Rabbit and Once upon a time in Hollywood but i 100% agree with this movie winning the Oscar.
Well done !"
32,Good movie with show you how to take advantage from another family. And how easy can be to replace people with easy tricks. I really like the idea. Everyone shows different types of people and way how to show themselves.
33,"Awesome movie, could appreciate every minute of it only because I learned how to read when I was a little child. Fair Oscar winner."
34,In 3 alphabets...wow... this movie transforms from dark comedy to family drama to a thriller to family drama with spellbinding sequences and perfect choreography. Keep entertaining us with such awesome cinema.
35,"I don't understand anyone giving this film anything less than a 9 or 10. It takes genius twists and turns, and I don't even usually like this genre! As for those not understanding certain character motives: please open your mind and consider cultural differences regarding boundaries, insults, manners, and class divides."
36,"This movie is honestly a masterpiece. I was so happy when it won best picture. ITs pacing is great, it has so many twists and turns that you are constantly invested in what is happening.It looks gorgeous too!The characters are so well formed and the script is just great. It funny too.People are often put off by subtitled films but i wish they would give them a chance as they miss out on films like this and more importantly foreign films fail to reach commercial success.So if you are at all interested in what you have heard about this movie, watch it you will love it."

11/11/19I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times."

11/09/19Disclaimer, this review is in two parts. Part One will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers. Part Two will delve deeper into the film itself, so read part 2 only if you're cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film. With that out of the way:Part One:Parasite is no misnomer. It fully lives up to its title, as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts. Parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities. I can't go a few minutes without remembering of some image, joke, line, or scene from the film. My self-diagnosis is apt and I fear I may be terminal.I think the best way to go into this film is to go how I went, totally blind. I've been looking forward to Parasite well before it took the Palme D'Or at Canne this year. Bong Joon-ho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece. A devilishly wild, pitch-black comedy, very much domesticated and between two families. I'll leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story. Just know this film is in Korean so it is subtitled. It loses nothing in translation but I really wish I knew how to speak Korean so I could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue.The story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls. Parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper, like quicksand, before too long you're in too deep. The editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by. It feels modern, sleek, and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad.It's worth traveling to see, with Joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that Parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities. My podunk friends, I apologize, you'll have to wait for a digital or physical release, likely around the end of the year. Lucky for you ""Terminator: Dark Fate,"" and John Cena's new firehouse dog movie ""Playing with Fire,"" will keep you company while you wait.Part Two: Where we actually talk about stuff, here be potential spoilers, ye' ave' been warnd' (sorry I am still processing The Lighthouse)Parasite is astonishing on an emotional level. It's a spiderweb of high tension thrills, hidden identities and masterfully curated small details. We meet the Kim family. Dirt poor, living in the basement level of a towering overcrowded building. Their lives are a struggle, phones turned off, internet turned off, it's an eye-opening depiction of poverty in 2019. The entire family (mother, father and two 'twentysomething' kids) is out of legitimate work, to help make some semblance of ends meet the entire family folds frozen pizza boxes for a young entrepreneur.
When a fortuitous opportunity arises for Ki-Woo (their son) to tutor the daughter of the ultra rich, affluent Park family, he finds a way to get each member of his family working for the Parks. It starts slowly, as his sister Ki-Jung acts an art therapist to young Da-Song, his father becomes Mr. Parks driver and his mother takes the place of the previous housekeeper.Typing that all out is simple enough, but none of these people are what they say they are. And the theatrical scams put in place to get the Kim family into the house are increasingly risky and hilarious. Ki-Woo (played by Woo-sik Choi) failed his college entry exam 4 times, his sister Ki-Jung (played by So-dam Park) is a true con artist, she literally Googled art therapy and ad-libbed everything else, his mom Chung-Sook (played by an awesome Hyae Din Chang), a physically intimidating champion shot putter is absolutely not a high end housekeeper, but most fraudulent of them all is dad, Ki-taek played by regular Bong Joon-ho collaborator Song Kang-Ho. I love this man. I love this actor. I love this character. He's totally pathetic, physically weak, he seemingly has no real skills. What is evident about his character is he truly loves his family. Seeing his face light up and beam with pride when his kids commit these scams is actually heartfelt and touching.I quickly fell in love with these characters as if they were my own family. You might get the misconception that the Park family might be rich, snobby, rude people but they really aren't. That's something I respect about Parasite, there aren't any clear cut villains or heroes. It's not that kind of story. It's so grounded in reality. Director and writer Bong Joon-ho apparently started getting this idea when he was an actual college tutor, in a luxurious house in which he didn't belong. He started thinking about how funny it would be to have his friends working in this house too.What really grips me with Parasite is how the movie utilizes senses. It's visually stunning, the architecture of the Park mansion contrasted with the shabby half basement the Kims live in, the way light, darkness and color is used, but maybe the most impressive is how much smell comes into play. You can't smell movies, but somehow Parasite has smells. Smell becomes a large part of the film. It's hard to explain but if you've seen Parasite you'll get what I am talking about.Bong Joon-ho has created something truly mesmerizing and thrilling. I do not have a single critique of the film. It's absolutely flawless and leaves a taste in your mouth long after viewing. I was absolutely convinced Quentin Tarantino's: ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" was the best film of the year but Parasite may have stolen my vote, or maybe that's exactly what the little bug in my brain wants me to say. See it as soon as possible."
39,"A great movie with outclass direction,Script,Story,Acting,Music all was too good,even before this movie south korea produce many masterpiece but we surprised win first time Cannes Prestigious ( Palm Di""or Award ,France) BAFTA( UK) Australian Academy award,Golden Globe , Screen Actor guild award & Oscar award etc this the only movie was in Oscar(2020) was tottaly deserve to win Best direction,Best movie,Best orignal script award"
40,"Hollywood's ""foreign"" classifications should be immediately done away with. What does the designation tell us about this extraordinary movie to call it ""foreign""? Foreign to whom and in what way? Yep, I get it, not made in America (Hollywood) and not in English. That designation means nothing used for a movie of such universal themes so easily accessible to the viewer. The director has observed the Kurosawa principle about balancing all the elements of the film's language, in addition to keeping to his own approach of keeping the narrative and dramatic aspects simple. Even with subtitles I was laughing out loud at the humorous bits. Can western movies claim that when they're subtitled in other languages? This sublime simplicity results in a movie so finely calibrated that it wipes out in one fell swoop the tiresome arthouse talking head cinematic tradition of the west. The South Korean film isn't ""foreign"", it's smack in the middle of a filmmaking tradition that respects the story, the viewer and the very medium of film. Think Kurosawa, again. How sublime in their simplicity are his movies? Critics carry in about what genre it is? What political and sociological commentary the director is trying out. None of that matters when a movie is so tonally pitch perfect. The ""change"" of pace about half way through is so seamless, one gasps long after the last frame that it couldn't possibly have gone any other way. It's the power of the impeccable story telling via the medium of film that elevates this movie above the fray.
Editing, acting, cinematography are all pitch perfect. Hollywood, go cry in your pretzels, with your endless commercial blockbusters and franchises. The centre of gravity has shifted and you are now the ""foreigner"" while the South Korean holds court in the center of the global cinematic universe. Thank you for giving it the ""best"" picture award full stop. It is one of the greatest films of all time in its tone, seamlessness, simplicity, and both the humour and tragedy of the human story it depicts. A great, great, great cinematic experience. Ten stars barely begins to convey the greatness."
41,"Perfectly told story with perfectly logical plots and motives for every character, justification for every frame and accompanied by a thought-provoking message that lingers long after you leave the theatre. Surely one of the best of cinema."
42,I've never watched a movie like this one. It's a masterpiece.
43,"The best movie of 2019 has everything: great acting, fabulous screenplay, with funny, tense and plot-twist moments, excelent directing, social critics and acid jokes. A monumental (but easy-to-consume) piece of art that satisfies all audience's tastes. Highly recommended."
44,"Parasite is a masterpiece, an unpredictable film about class division that skillfully manages to easily combine different genres and create a truly unique and complex experience that's smart, funny and tense. All of the performances are incredible with Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park giving the standout performances. Bong Joon-ho's direction is incredible, it's beautifully filmed and the pacing is superb, constantly extremely engaging for the entirety of its run time. The music by Jung Jae-il is amazing."
45,I just finished this movie. This whole movie give an amazing experience. The story is beyond our imagination. The performance of the all cast is just outstanding. It's a must watch for all movie lovers.
46,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10"
47,This movie is really great korean movie with great cast and just idea for this movie is unique and it is one of best foreign movies out there
48,"I came to see this hyped-out title and was expecting to see it flop, only to be amazed by its brilliance and cinematography. Simplicity without a doubt is the ultimate sophistication.I feel Parasite was an infastation to Western cinematography, taking all tip awards and leaving nothing behind. Eastern cinema has a lot more to offer than cheesy martial arts and special effects, and Parasite is the gateway towards this level of cinematic appreciation.
This movie portrays a lower-class family, making ends meet and struggling to survive in a capitally oriented world, by skipping into the higher layer of society. Although they have less to show, they are more of a family than their higher-class counterpart, living the life of riches without ever fully experiencing any of it together. In a way, it blends and clearly separates these two worlds, similair in essence but completely different in reality.It is a manifesto on class struggles and how social stratification represents an unpenetrable rock wall, where a lifetime is not enough to break free and move to a higher layer. Because of this, you are forced to become a parasite and take from others to grow, or remain a parasite of society and depend on the generousity of the Rich.In the end, one has to wonder if Capital is a true parasite of our lives, taking our focus from the importance of the human experience and manipulating our life's purpose as it pleases?"
49,"This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones.
Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience."

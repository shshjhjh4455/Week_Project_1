1,"If you are a lover of Horror & Thriller movie... Then you have to watch this Fil.
In the end you see the love of a Father.."
2,"Definitely one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen! Had some suspense and action in it too, which built up making it more to anticipate, and it did not disappoint! This movie is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, finally something worth watching!"
3,I absolutely loved this movie. The ending part made me cry. I have never cried before that hard. My best zombie movie so far.
4,Hands down the best zombie movie ever I've seen yet.
5,"I've been wanting to see this movie for a while and its was so worth it. This is the only other zombie movie to ever make me cry. Throughout this movie, my anxiety was up but it was totally worth it. I wasn't disappointed. Now its 1:22 AM and I should get some sleep."
6,"This movie has it all, fun, action,drama, thrill, emotions everything. Every moment of the movie can make you sit untill it's over. Gong Yoo did one of his best work I'd say. Story was justified by actors totally. It took me months to get over the movie, but it's a worth watching movie. Every moment has a thrill, you won't get bored, keeps you hooked the whole time. You'd get different feeling for each character. Lol, though I was worried if what if a Zombie Apocalypse breaks in for real. XD. If you are real thriller fan also want some zombie spice in it, you should watch this movie for sure. Also it is not only a one time watch film, you would relive each moment again and again if you watch the movie more than once just like me. I still cry the way I first time did even now."
7,This movie will make you believe in zombies and excellent movie making.
8,"Honestly, When I first bought this film the only thing I knew about it was that it was a zombie film.But watching this film without having much prior knowledge about it creates a better viewing experience.This film is perfectly filmed in regards of setting. Referring to the train. It allows for a realistic sense of claustrophobia making scenes that much more suspenseful. Nowadays it feels like there is no originality within films however this film is different from the rest.It nails all aspects of what a good film should be. The incredible story allows for a simplistic but powerful ending. The acting should be mentioned as a big plus, with all actors providing an outstanding performance which gives the story a sense of verisimilitude.This film is a perfect example of what horror should be."
9,It is better than all the american zombie movies it shows america that how to make a zombie movie
10,We all love Zombie movies but once again Korea brings a fresh take on a stake genre. This movie is non stop action and all the character s resemble society. These aren't your slow rolling Zombies but sprinters who want a pi e of the action. Take this train.
11,Good crisp writing tells the story of a diverse group of people stuck on a train with a zombie outbreak. Lots of action intermingled with character development. That's good writing.
12,"South korea Far ahead then Hollywood to produce outclass Zombie movie i still regret to not watch this in cinema,Direction,Story,Acting,Music,Visual effect all was just too good, Korean are masters to divert emotiones & Devolped stories in Depth
Ending movie will can easily break evry one heart,normally i not liked Zombie movies at all ,watched Hollywood famous Movie World war Z, 28 weaks later, Shaun of the Dead ,Dawan of the dead & many more but not liked it this first Zombie movie just loved it"
13,"Well i not liked zombie movies, watch soo many hollywood movies but was plain,bore this korean Zombie movie was such a masterpiece ,Direction,Script ,Acting,Camera work,visual effects was very solide & with full of emotiones in which hollywood mostly lake off."
14,"What a pleasant surprise this was. If you're into zombie movies and can deal with subtitles, this is the movie to watch. You fall in love with MOST of the characters and you can't help but root for them. The cast was incredible. I think anyone who watched this just witnessed an up and coming star in Kim Soo-Ahn who played the little girl Su-an in the movie. Dont let the subtitles steer you away. You get used to them."
15,"Train to Busan is a ridiculously tense horror that's scary, visceral and surprisingly emotional with effective social commentary. Gong Yoo, Ma Dong-Soek and Kim Soo-Ahn are all incredible. Woo Sik-Choi, Jung Yu-Mi, Sohee and Kim Ui-Seong are all great. Yeon Sang-Ho's direction is superb, it's extremely well filmed and superbly paced, relentlessly tense until the very end. The visual effects are fantastic and the music by Jang Young-Gyu is excellent."
16,"You would think the age of zombie flicks has passed, considering the market was saturated with them. But then along came Train to Busan and absolutely wreck havoc (in a good way) in this stale genre.First I would like to praise the director and the crew, considering that they with a very modest budget and insanely short period of time managed to create a fantastic movie!The cast too was absolutely great, where they would portray several archetypes of human behaviour and succeed splendidly!Train to Busan, is an amazing, refreshing, action zombie flick. 
Where the gripping reality and human shame come to light.If you want a good movie I cannot recommend Train to Busan, because it is a GREAT movie!Cheerio,"
17,I am a big fan of South Korean Movies...not so much Zombie movies of any kind... I took a chance on watching this one. It was EXCELLENT it will make you jump in your chair at times and screaming RUN at the TV. This is a must watch movie!The movie is well acted and the zombies are very well played by the actors... you wont be disappointed.
18,"This movie made me cry. And also this is the first korean I've watched. I thought that these 3 ( small girl, her dad and a woman) will be saved but the twist seriously made me so cry. I thought 3 of them will live together to make atleast a bit happy ending although everyone was killed but this made me cry a lot after a small child started singing for her father's death. Such a emotional and thrilling story. This movie deserves 10 star an."
19,"There's just something so special about this movie. It's introduction to characters is done in a special way and at a good pace to make you almost feel connected to them. I, personally, didn't care if the zombies were slow or fast, or even if you'd consider them zombies. Their relentless speed kept me on edge the whole movie! It definitely displays the effects of ""Selfishness vs Selflessness"" and the ""Collective vs the Few"".
It's just such a beautiful movie that doesn't get the recognition it most definitely deserves!!Side Note: On the date of me writing this review, (8/16/2020), Train to Busan is on Netflix but if it's not when you view this, it's definitely worth the purchase. You won't regret it!"
20,This movie is far better than many Hollywood zombie apocalyptic movies.
21,Incredible from beginning to end. That young girl is without a doubt one of the best child actors I've ever come across. Everyone was brilliant.
22,This movie is unlike any other. I know you're probably saying this sounds generic like any other review I've read but let me change your mind. I'm an advid movie viewer and I haven't seen something so intense yet breathtaking in a horror film such as this one. From starting off seeming generic to completely throwing you off and taking you on a journey you didn't expect. It's breathtaking art work and character performance captures the essence of the viewer and delivers something emotionally engaging that rarely comes from movies especially a horror movie. Please give this movie a chance because it's definitely worth a watch.
23,I cried a lot at the end go for it not that scary.Watch it without any second thought. Just watch it you are missing some quality stuff acting is great everything is over the top love it
24,"An overall excellent movie
A friend of mine recommended this movie. In his words, it would be ""a kickass Korean zombie flick"", so naturally i went into this movie expecting another generic, dumb, goofy zombie splatter film. Boy, was I in for a surprise!First of all, the acting is spot on. All the actors are doing a tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you, without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional. Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by the movie's finale.Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick. It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre. However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10."
25,"While it does have many similar components to other zombie movies, this stands above and beyond most. The acting is good, as is the storyline. Exceptional cinematography. Well worth the watch."
26,I nearly turned it off at the beginning due to it being subtitled as I am not a great lover of foreign movies. I am so glad I didn't. Best Zombie movie I have seen in a long time and I have seen a lot! The story line was really good which I didn't expect as most of the action is limited to a train. The acting was believable. I didn't like the Sang-hwa character at first but he grew on me. I found myself caring for the characters and wanting them to survive this apocolypse. Well done to all the cast and crew for giving us a great train ride of a movie.
27,No questions asked! Just watch. 10/10 easy. No questions asked. 10/10.
28,"""Train to Busan"" is filled with action, zombies and characters that you'll love and care for - with a character you'll truly hate and want to die - along with its uniqueness. It also has a fresh take on the zombie genre, making it a thrilling, satisfying and unpredictable train ride."
29,"Yup, it's different. although zombies are the central element of the storyline, this movie just about zombies and survival and that's what i loved about this movie.
It's about decisions we make. its about the good and bad in us. its about that transformation between good & evil and Yeon Sang-ho tries to show it in almost every part of the movie. with an ending of so much stillness after an intense action scene this movie is a masterpiece in itself."
30,"Great movie!!!!Man I'm just fully mesmerized..Not a typical zombie movie. It has everything which a movie needs to be great. It has action,thrill, emotions. A very heart touching. Director just nailed it."
31,"Honestly the first time I wanted to watch it, I only watched 10 minutes of it and then I was bored, however I had seen so many good reviews so I decided to give it a try and so I did. WOW this movie made me cry and scream lol I really felt like I was there, I honestly love it and totally recommend it."
32,"This movie is a MUST SEE...and please watch it with the Korean audio and subtitles, it will take more than one session to read all the conversations though, but as you want to watch the movie again and again it's no waste of your time....
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
33,"I'm not that into Zombie flicks, but I really liked this one. Aside from the zombie grappling action scenes which were pretty cliched, the truly compelling characters and the interactions between them is what makes this film a 10 for me.
The fractured relationship between the overworked 'arsehole' dad and his despondent daughter as he begrudgingly escorts her on the train to Busan so she could see her mother on her birthday, the two old ladies who have clearly been close friends for life, the true arsehole of the film who's only interest is his personal wellbeing, the possibly schizophrenic tramp, who people look upon as undesirable but grows in character and regard as the film progresses, and many others. But the star of this film is the little girl who is so expressive her story is written on her face and through the body language she has with her father and the people she meets on the train. 
 This film is pretty cheesy on the face of it, I mean what would you expect from a Korean zombie film. But It goes without saying such well developed characters in such a desperate situation lays bare in the most explicit way, human nature, the good and the bad. And some scenes will have even the most hardened hearts having to fight off a tear or two."
34,"I've seen this movie 6 times and never get tired of it. 
I recommend it to anyone"
35,"I'm a huge fan of 80's B-horror movies with lots of cheesy gore in it and this movie is nothing like that. This is actually a good movie. The story is nice and touching, there's a lot of suspense, the quality is nice and it's aesthetically appealing to watch. It's just a nice film that's beautifully brought."
36,"I do not really write reviews but I had to write one for this... It's just binds you and keeps you tact till the end and the way everything's so realistic makes it even much better! Aah I watched it with English subtitles still the impact of this movie on me is impeccable!
Hat's off"
37,"This is a must see for zombie enthusiasts - what a ride! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. First off, the characters are colorful, yet easy to relate to. I would say the supporting characters are some of the best and well written characters I've seen in a horror genre...ever. I was pleased to see there was a lot of attention to detail on each and every character. The location is unique (98% of the film is shot on a moving train) and it really adds to the high stakes, fast paced, high stress environment. I thought they did a great job creating a space and environment that really added to the story in many layers. It was thematic, metaphorical, helped pace out the film, and overall it was a great visual. This is a must watch."
38,"From start to finish this film is near flawless. Great character build up with 1st class acting. A very scary story although zombie movies are now 10 a penny. This one certainly has that something special.
The acting by the little girl Su-an Kim was outstanding. What an emotional performance. I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. If you think you have had enough of zombie movies watch this one. It's more than a cut above the rest."
39,"In Korea ,the virus was dangerous...the korean population was infected by this virus ,so dangerous !
In my opinion , Train to Busan is beautiful and captivating movie.
The score is very emotional,I cry during this movie because the score was very important in this movie ,and emotional for my ears !
I think,this cast was a very good choice! Yoo-Gong is very charismatic and he played very good in general.
If you like or love the action movie,you should see Train to Busan !"
40,"Train to Busan is Korea's the first zombie film and also one of the best zombie films of all time. I rarely watch Korean films, but when I saw this film, I was totally surprised because it's the first.As the film name, Train to Busan, the whole thing happened on the train. So, the filming location scope is small but it turned out great. What I like of this film is it shows if you don't want to die, you'll die quicker than usual. So, we don't need to afraid of dying. We all have to die one day anyway. No one can avoid it.I really hate that CEO guy. The way he try to survive by pushing all people around him to die is something I hate most. And also I hate Koreans always love to kill off the main character(s), making the film unhappy ending. If they make the film end with some kind of happy ending, it'd be better than this.The makeup skills, special effects used in this film and performances of actors and actresses are good, so that the film becomes better and better. Even though this film is the first zombie film that Koreans ever made, it's like they had a lot of experiences with zombie films. They could make a great one on the first go.Although there are some things that I don't like in this film, it still makes one of the best zombie films I've ever watched. It's enjoyable, so, I recommend you all to watch it."
41,"I don't like giving 10 stars, it implies I am lazy or overzealous but I honestly can't think of anything to knock a star off for.
I dunno if that is how the Koreans do stuff (I've only seen one other Korean horror film that I know of, The Host) but this was a sweet and spicy movie. The spicy part was all over the place in the form of slavering hordes of really stressed out zombies who probably need to chill. There was plenty of action and distinct rounded characters in some big scenes.
The sweet was the truly tragic note to the finale which, like in The Host really grabbed you in the feels. Kim Soo An is a great actor and I hope they didn't do something nasty to make her cry like that."
42,The claustrophobic nature of the train mixed with the intensity of World War Z or 28 Days Later styles of zombies makes for an exciting viewing.
43,"This is such a great and truly underrated movie. Cinematography and acting is great, the effects were pretty good for something that isn't from Hollywood and huge budgets. And the best part is, there is no Hollywood crap like two charachters kissing in the middle of the escape scene. I really enjoyed this movie and it was way better than what i expected."
44,"Train To Busan, it's a south korean horror film, directed by Yeon Sang-ho. it lasted 118min ( it's one of the best 118min in my life Xd ). This movie is set in South Korea!
It started with Seok-Woo ( Gong Yoo ) who accepted his doughter's request, which is to take her to Busan to see her mother, because it's Su-An's birthday ( Well.. Su-An is the daughter:) ).. But the journey has been disrupted by a hellish on-board zombie outbreak.. And the real story begins... Who will survive? and How?
I think that it is more than a horror movie, because it shows how selfish, greedy a human can be... And It makes you realize how precious your father is. He is the one who will make many sacrifices for you when no-one will.. 
The ending was especially well-done and sentimental. A child who saved lives through her singing.. Which make me realize that music makes us feel secure..
Overall, ' Train To Busan ' is the best Zombie movie ( It's exciting, emotional and heartbreaking ) with a good child actor! Also the performances are convincing...
If you are a Zombie fan, you should definitly give this movie a try ;)."
45,"'Train to Busan' is a thoroughly enjoyable, nail biting, scary, occasionally thought-provoking experience, heart-wrenching, innovative, effective and technically excellent movie. The background score is very effective. The Koreans do know how to make a great movie! MUST WATCH!!"
46,"If you are eagerly finding some of the best zombie movies than its worth watching for you. amazing pace with extraordinary acting & twist. everyone did brilliant job. you can't differentiate between a hollywood movie & this one. technically this is better than as usual hollywood zombie movies. watch it, i guarantee you won't regret."
47,"This movie was fantastic for a few reasons... It is faced paced once the action kicks up.. Time isn't wasted on tons of irrelevant character history, it is about the ""in the moment"" character empathy.. Were this movie got me was it's heart. Most hollywood cookie cutter action flicks have some kid with unreal ""talents"" at it's core... This movie has a child.. just a normal child, but what a great lil' actress she is. The whole movie was a great ride!"
48,"It's been a while since I've seen a really good movie and a really good zombie movie at that. But Train to Busan is LIIIIIIIT!!! I was exhausted by the end of this movie. Everytime you though you catch a little break, BAM! Something else goes wrong. It was a never ending thrill ride! If you are looking for something truly entertaining to watch, this movie is it!"
49,Train to Bushan is one of the best movie in its genre. It is a must watch zombie movie.

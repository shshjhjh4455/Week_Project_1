0,9,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. Starring Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Chang Hyae-jin, Park So-dam, Cho Yeo-jeong, Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Jung-eun, Jeong Ji-so, Park Myung-hoon, Jung Hyeon-jun, Park Seo-joon, Park Geun-rok. (R)Teen-aged Choi, from a lower-class, unemployed family, deceives his way into a position as tutor for the daughter within the prosperous Park family; soon, the rest of his family begins ingratiating (and insinuating) themselves into the Park's lives. To tell more would spoil the pleasures of this deliciously demented parable on class, greed, prejudice and more. As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up. Amusing scriptwriting workshop exercise idea: present the first twenty minutes and last twenty minutes of the movie and see how someone tries to navigate a connection between the endpoints.91/100"
1,5,"I am not Korean and maybe I cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film, beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me. In some scenes I saw an actor or actress pretty weak, in the next rather strong. Sometimes I had the feeling they were no professional actors at all. And I can judge acting and I know that that was not on purpose. The camera work was good, I really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes, some misleading, others very clear. Would the storyline have been as thorough as that, this would be a great movie, in my opinion. But it wasn´t. None of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments. The dichotomy of a society, here in lower class people and the rich, worked well yet a little stereotypical. The poor were poor but witty, the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive. Would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down? No, it wouldnt, that´s what this film tells us. It´s a satire, of course. For a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side, the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a well-thought script. Like some others here, I don´t know why this got an Oscar for best movie. Was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win?"
2,8,"Looks like a few people failed to grasp the films message. It's a more cerebral watch than their intellect can handle. Ha ha.A dark dramatic black comedy film with a strong social commentary.Hugely enjoyable and well deserving of its many accolades.See it now before Hollywood tries to remake it and ruins its excellence.
A fabulous director."
3,6,"I think there's a really good movie buried in ""Parasite"" somewhere, but I gave up trying to find it. It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken.That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.Pity. Some of the sequences were brilliant."
4,5,"I didn't think this film was particular good it's not as smart as it thinks it is, the infiltration of the house was unrealistic and the so called twist was predictable. The oscars have no credibility these days."
5,8,"This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. ""Parasite"" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - """"If you make a plan, life never works out that way"". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I'm not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture's chances at the Oscars. It won 'Best Picture' last night in a pretty competitive field. Congratulations!"
6,8,"When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient. They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood. When I see a decent foreign film I can't help but want to praise it more because they don't have the multi-billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them. Usually, they have to be more creative, more ingenious, and more resourceful.""Parasite"" is one of very few Korean films I've watched in my life. My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung-fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space. Korean films are a rarity for me. This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received.What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script.How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable.Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners."
7,9,"This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeous Cho Yeo-jeong for whom I may confess I have a crush.As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!"
8,7,"I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Probably the best movie of the year.7 stars"
9,9,"My Review- Parasite
My Rating 9/10I'm so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer/ director Bong Joon Ho.Parasite has already received numerous accolades, with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best International Feature Film, making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.The film's title ""Parasite"" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said ""Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.""I read Director and script writer Bong Joon
is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home.
I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film.Unfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon.
It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on.
Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce.Of course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year .
I still think it's odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I'm certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to. I'm still so fond of Pedro Almodóvar's Pain & Glory..Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this.After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more.
There's so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite. The story depicts Class divides, Climate Catastrophes, Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment.
I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it's unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film .This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing ""Emma"" this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series ""Succession ""portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup.
The common thread that Parasite, Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it's survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently, dresses differently or anyone doesn't process a degree or wealth.
The poor family's ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular, neurotic self obsessed rich Park family.2 comments from Parasite said by Ki-taek and wife Chung-sook stay in my mind .Ki-taek: They are rich but still nice.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: They are nice because they are rich.Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: If I had all this I would be kinder.Ki-taek: Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites-parasiteLearn to pronounce

10,9,"Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10."
11,10,"South Korean film crews may be World Cinema's most painstakingly dedicated; the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision, on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also produce some of our time's most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process.We meet the impoverished Kim family, father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and we soon learn they aren't the most honest bunch. Ki-woo, through his friend Min-hyuk, gets hired as a homeschool English teacher, using forged Oxford documents, at the home of the upper-class Park family; tech company CEO Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), his stressed-out wife Yeon-gyo (a wonderful Cho Yeo-jeong), teen daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and little Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). This is but the beginning of the Kim family's sneaky ascent.Learning of Da-song's troubles, Ki-woo, going by ""Kevin"", informs Mrs. Park of an art therapist he knows named ""Veronica"", who is actually Ki-jeong, who may help Da-song evolve. Through a series of events I won't spoil, ""Veronica"" later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki-taek, going by ""Mr. Kim"", who in turn recommends a new housekeeper, played by Chung-sook.The way the Kims continually fool the Parks - from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad-libbing based on research they've done for the fields they pretend to work in - is clever, tense, impossible to predict, and morbidly hilarious throughout. It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it's edited (for instance: cutting from Ki-taek lying to Yeon-gyo, to him finishing the same sentence during Ki-woo's rehearsals), how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done (the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence), and how utterly believable these performances are.The actors who portray the Kims, in particular, give remarkably layered performances. Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment, plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family's home employees.The characters themselves are convincing actors, hence their successful duping of the Parks, which makes each real-world actor's performance all the more considerable. And yes, it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position, but the film is self-aware and deliberate about this, not only because the Parks - in their carefree luxury - aren't the most observant.This is all comical to experience, yes, but what Bong has to say about class inequity and - during the film's bleaker, later scenes - how it isn't necessarily so simple as letting the poor ""have some luxury"" for the sake of fairness, is what makes Parasite stick. We may understand the downtrodden Kims (we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique), and laugh at their conniving schemes, but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end?Parasite is generally well-loved, but divisive in the circles you'd expect. My guilty-pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families (also calling it a ""cancel-culture comedy"" because, I guess, anti-family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to ""cancel"" offensive celebrities and, indeed, berate classism). So far as I can decipher, White's main evidence is the fact that, in the story, a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi-titular social parasites - whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists.As mentioned, the Kims aren't strictly heroes or justified. Isn't this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters (read: villains) who co-opt our customs perversely? But then, psh, who'd reason like that?"
12,9,"""It's so metaphorical"" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that ""It's so metaphorical"" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.""It's so metaphorical"" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes."
13,8,"The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable.
Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society.
As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house
only to get the shock of their life.Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of
a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences.
The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main
drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the
old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads
to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member
and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message.
There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking
up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling
and this is where Parasite scores.Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction
is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be
Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5"
14,10,"Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it."
15,10,"Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets."
16,2,Maybe people get too emotional in West. May be that is why it got an Oscar. There's nothing special about this movie; the story so average.
17,9,"(Flash Review)WOW! I did not see all that coming. The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family's life to feed off them like parasites. They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family's trust. With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale. The story was original, well-written and semi-believable with twists that don't cheat the viewer. Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating. This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch, enjoy, ponder."
18,9,"Bong Joon Ho directed one of my favorite movies of 2017, Okja, and has done it again in 2019 with Parasite. A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020."
19,10,"Bong Joon Ho's film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing, mischievous energy and spiked with sharply-drawn characters, with varying shades of moral and ethical decay. It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns.It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat.Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever.For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended."
20,10,"In the midst of Writer and Director Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" wealthy Korean High-Tech CEO Dong-ik Park, played by handsome bold Sun-kyun Lee, describes to his wife Yeon-kyo, played by beautifully capricious Yeo-jeong Jo: His new driver Kim, played by brilliantly overwhelmed Kang-ho Song. Dong-ik says of Kim, ""He never crosses the line."" Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim.Paradoxically, Bong's ""Parasite"" purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. ""It's all about them"". In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung.Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go.Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin.Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee.Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. Naïve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life.Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times. Surprise twists reveal. The absurd hysterical devolves into absurd hysteria. I believe Bong's inventive madness does serve his purpose.In the quiet scene at the Park home, Ki-woo sadly yearns while looking upon all the beautiful rich people at a Birthday party. It's his life that might have been. Rather, it's his life that isn't.Director Bong brazenly explores the very fringes of sociopathy with both artistic style and menacing humor in ""Parasite"". His narrative is ultimately about karma. Absolutely there are consequence for what we do. What we do, can and will come back at us.Yes, ""Parasite"" is darkly hysterical, in your face provocative. It's great to look at with authentic performances. ""Parasite"" might be one of best movies of 2019. I really liked the movie a whole lot.All that being said: ""Parasite"" is not my very favorite movie of 2019. Perhaps, humanity by its very design is dark and light. At least for me, ""Parasite"" fails in its balance of the dark and the light. Again, just saying."
21,10,"Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think ""masterpiece"" is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon."
22,1,"I'm sorry, am I missing something here? Every celebrity, message board poster and even the former President of the United States Obama are saying this was the best movie of the year.It's just not good! Why is this being considered one of the best of the year? I'm totally lost. This is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. To put it bluntly, even Michael Bay's worst Transformers movie is better than this dreck.I came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next City of God based on the hype. It's actually on the level of a movie on Netflix that I'd spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking ""thumbs down.""Don't waste your time, trust me on this.I forgot to add, it's very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off Shameless in many ways. They were definitely inspired by it."
23,10,Best movie of 2019. I am in awe. In fact it's one the best movies i have ever seen in my life. What a masterpiece no wonder it won the top award at the cannes film festival. You can never guess what is going to happen next or how it will end. Damn !! Wow and it begs the question who is the victim here?
24,10,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."
25,9,"Only mild spoilers.If you are looking for film that skillfully evokes a myriad of emotions from the audience - you've landed-on it! The Koreans have always been great at combining tones/genre's. Parasite Is a deftly handled film about social classes, income disparity(in particular, the psychological impact of it) and karma.Song Kang-Ho gives the standout performance as the father of a poor family who seems perfectly willing to break through any ethical walls to climb their way out of the slums.The meat of the storyline comes when the fathers' son infiltrates a wealthy household as an English tutor. Does the event spark an opportunity for financial freedom or horror for the entire family?This is both a visually and intelligently spectacular vision, played out to near perfection. There is some great symbolism throughout the film - the highs of high society, and the drowning abyss of the lower class. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.The film is also as funny as it is thrilling. Hopefully American audiences can take all of the comedy-in as some can literally be lost in translation and dryness.The films' not perfect. I think the poor fathers emotional state could have been fortified a bit with a longer opening set-up; if for no other reason but to drive home the income disparity impact in Korea. Americans may not fully understand the dangers of income disparity and the ""monopolization and manipulation of capitalism(a good system but not necessarily a foolproof one), but perhaps watching this will help. That aspect of the ending is a slightly under-developed, or just perhaps under-appreciated according to your demographic, though the ending as a whole is still well-fashioned and thought-provoking.I've only seen a few of the Best Picture nominees(Fordv8, 19178, Once Upon a Time7.5-8, and Irishman7) , but this is clearly my personal favorite. It wont win. IMO, The Oscars gifted ""The Artist"" the ""foreign acknowledgement Best Picture"" a few years back, so it may be awhile before we see another one. Not that there haven't been many that should have one or at least been nominated. On direction, writing, acting, cinematography, and pure enjoyment - this film checks every box for me.You might like this if you liked: The Host(7), 3-Iron(7.5-8), Nightcrawler(8), Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance(8)"
26,5,Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.
27,10,"Song Kang-ho is one of my favorite South Korean actors and I've seen many of his films. However, I hadn't seen a Korean film since a long time, and once I heard all the good things about Parasite and the amount of acclaim it has earned, I couldn't stop myself from watching it. And whoever said it slowly transforms into something unexpected, wasn't kidding at all! Parasite started as a drama with shades of dark humor, before morphing into an edge of the seat thriller that keeps you captivated and shocks you to the extent that you can't even move. It's that spellbinding.The film can't be easily put into one genre, and that's true. Still, whether you like black comedies/dramas/thrillers or not, you must see this film at least once. It's just that you need to prepare yourself to be shocked because once the surprises start coming, you can't forget any of that for a long time. Parasite runs a little more than 2 hours but is so captivating that it might feel like the shortest 2 hours of all time.Words won't be sufficient to further describe this film's actual brilliance. I'm still spellbound. What started like a fun movie became something so surprising that it was hard to forget after it ended. It took away the very feel of watching a film. Whatever I saw just felt real, absolutely real. No doubt, Parasite is one of the most original films you'll see in the recent memory, and surprisingly has elements of almost every genre covered in its entire duration. Let's hope it wins big at the Oscars too!"
28,10,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece.
This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible.
Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.
In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING."
29,10,"Greetings from Lithuania.Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korea'n movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i thing that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion.""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. Its a universal theme.And this movie is a universal treasure."

0,"""Minari"" is one heartfelt touching family drama of love and wisdom as a viewer sees how being together grows a family strong no matter what kind of cards are dealt their way. Set in the early 80's a Korean American family has moved from the hustle and hassle world of California to the rural south to an Arkansas farm for a chance at the American dream, as new roots of goals and life have been planted. Jacob(the good Steven Yeun) and Monica(Yeri Han) want to break from their 9 to 5 life of working at a chicken factory so Jacob invest in the earth and land and equipment to start planting seeds to grow harvest so he can become a fine farmer. Their two small kids David(Alan S. Kim who's so cute) and Anne(Noel Cho) have to adjust to a new school and life that involves church too. And things do twist and spin even more when their stubborn and go against the grain rule breaking grandmother Soonja(Yuh-Jung-Youn) arrives. Grandma is loving and caring though and she brings a little seed of magic and hope to the Arkansas farm! Challenges and ups and downs are common still thru it all this picture shows that at home if a family has love, togetherness, with hard work and determination they will last no matter what happens. Overall wonderful film that one will love watching as they see a strong masterful family."
1,"Last year Parasite won Best picture and it was fair, it was great, but my heart´s favorite was Jojo Rabbit.This year is the same, tho i don´t know which film will get he oscar home i know it won´t be Minari.It´s a warm movie with little problems that end up being vey important, you create a little connection with each one of the characters.I totally recommend it to everyone."
2,"Minari is the ultimate movie about the Asian immigrant experience in (rural) America. It is authentic, heartwarming and beautifully written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung. Its bilingual cast is also responsible for some of the most memorable performances in recent times - culminating in well-deserved Oscar and BAFTA wins for Yuh Jong Youn. There is a lot to digest in this movie - positive racial themes assimilation, family values, survival. Ageing issues, perseverance and intercultural friendship. For my money, Minari should have won all the major awards at the Oscars this year, but it would be too much to expect the Academy to recognise two Korea-related movies in consecutive years - Parasite won last year. Notwithstanding, Minari has a special place in my heart as this was the movie that lifted me during the lowest point of the pandemic lockdown and brought a smile (and tears) to my face."
3,"Minari is a phenomenal drama about the struggles of starting a new life that's emotional, heartwarming and breathtakingly beautiful whilst also being earnest and funny. Steven Yeun, Yeri Han, Alan Kim, Noel Katie Cho and Yuh-Jung Youn are all perfect. Lee Isaac Chung's direction is incredible, it's extremely well filmed and consistently visually stunning. It's extremely well paced and the music by Emile Mosseri is amazing."
4,"Endearing characters, gorgeous cinematography, and a strong script make Minari a nearly perfect film!"
5,"These are the types of pieces of media that should be getting more attention.Everything in this production felt fresh and humble.Hard work really does pay off, absolutely perfect. Fully worthy of all the praise.Best Film of the year."
6,"This film joins a long line of media that takes on immigrants assimilating into American culture. The Jungle, House of Sand and Fog, American Tale, Once Upon a Time in America, Brooklyn etc. Etc. All come to mind. This one stands apart both because it is centered on a Korean family and because it takes place in a rural area. (Jacob is fairly ""American"" in his distaste for cities). The film is a low-key intimate story that functions as a coming of age tale and a portrait of a family trying to make it. It is wonderfully observed-each member of the Yi family feels like a person you could meet. The grandmother-Soon-ja-especially is a striking character both because of the writing and the wonderful Youn Yuh-jung.The film has a quiet power to much of the proceedings-the emotional heft sneaks up on you; some it doesn't hit until long after the movie is over. The film is open ended in most of its plot threads-i.e. Does the family make it? Stay together?-but it has a completeness to it that slice of life films do. Chung-as writer and director-has a clear vision that makes it to the screen. This has the complexities and failings of the American experience. The film might be in Korean but it is rooted in a big part of what makes this country what it is-immigration."
7,"And that really bites! I love this guy, and though I don't know exactly what he was trying to tell me at the end it felt really profound and plucked at my heartstrings , I love his idea of family and how he juxtaposes functional with dysfunctional and blends the two so that we get a more interesting outlook on the family nucleus so much so that soon our interests are piqued at a fever pitch and intrigue is born! I loved it! I love the lil' boy , Asian Boy he was so nice!"
8,"I love when I can get entrenched in a movie. But most movies don't have all the elements that it takes for that to happen: a unique storyline, a main cast where every character is essential and every actor carries a big load. Check and check! Also appealing was there was no bells and whistles to distract and detract from the story. Loved this movie! Been a Steven Yeun fan since ""Walking Dead"". He was great. Alan S. Kim deserved an Oscar consideration too!"
9,"America is a melting pot of many cultures from all around the world. There are so many different stories beginning, ending, or taking place in our country within the lives of people from all walks of life and nearly every corner of the world. That being said, I absolutely loved 'Minari.' It's the story of a South Korean family trying to live out their American dream in the random state of Arkansas. It shows how both parents have differing ideas of what that American dream is, as do the children (who I assume were born in the U.S.) When the grandmother joins the picture, the story takes another turn.I love the grandmother character. She's funny, straightforward, and loving. The grandmother is the glue that brings everyone back together, but she accomplishes this without intending to and in a subtle way. She brings with her many of the South Korean customs the kids are not aware of and introduces them to a Korean plant known as Minari, which serves as the secret ingredient in many Korean dishes. Minari ends up serving as the most important symbol in the story, in that just like this plant does to Korean meals and remedies, the grandma brings out the best of the family. The film ends with the father and son visiting the Minari patch the grandmother grew by a stream in the woods. I believe the ending is left up to interpretation and I like to think that the father decided to sell the Minari to retailers in the city.I have understood that the story is based on the director's personal experience and it shows. Much of the dialogue sounds very realistic, you can tell he was digging through his memories when writing this. The acting is fantastic, everyone does a great job with their roles. My personal favorite performances were from the grandma and the little boy. I think these actors complimented each other so well, you can see the gradual connection that takes place between them. Every scene between them is fantastic.I highly recommend this film. I hope to see more films like this in the near future, telling the story of those who tend to get overseen in our country. Congrats to everyone who worked on this film. Hope it gets the recognition it deserves."
10,"""Remember what we said when we got married? That we'd move to America and save each other?""A24 always has that one film each year that's so incredibly moving. Last year they gave us The Farewell among the success of The Lighthouse and Midsommar. Because those two are so popular, it's hard not to ignore the fact that it's under appreciated, especially after the Oscar snubs. In a year where they haven't released much due to many scheduling changes, Minari, thankfully, doesn't fall under that circumstance. I adored Minari and all that it had to offer. The plot is fairly simple. A Korean family moves to Arkansas to start a farm in the 1980s. Sometimes it's the simplest of stories that touch our hearts the most. I love how simple of a story it is. It never feels too overbearing or trying to do more than it's capable of. Because of the simplicity, the screenplay comes off natural. It's a very honest look at a life that undergoes a brand new lifestyle. This family changes almost completely from moving from California to Arkansas. The people are different, the surroundings, just everything in general. Add in the complications of an unsatisfied marriage and a grandmother coming to live with them after them being gone for so many years, and you have a great screenplay. Lee Isaac Chung's screenplay is a must for a nomination otherwise that would be a criminal offense, just like The Farewell. Even director would be great. His direction is practically flawless in my eyes. I couldn't see anyone else tackling this story but him. It's the way he translates the tone from the screenplay to the screen that's so incredibly wonderful. I felt emotional even at times that aren't meant to be sad. There's always a connection to character and story.The acting is phenomenal from this great ensemble. The two kids, David and Anne, are really good. Never did they have a bad scene or trouble with acting. We spend more time with David and grow an extreme attachment to him. Alan S. Kim is now my favorite child actor. What's more amazing is his chemistry with Youn Yuh-jung. Youn Yuh-jung plays the grandma that we all love. Again, going back to The Farewell, Zhao Shuzhen had the lovable grandma and had a huge Oscar snub. With our pool of supporting actresses right now, I believe she is a lock and after the snub for The Farewell Last year they will do their best to make it up. She's definitely my favorite supporting actress of the year and I don't know how anyone could be disappointed. Yeri Han is significantly overlooked right now. I loved her development and point of view of everything going on. She's worried about the future and wants to keep the family together, but her husbands opposing views add to the complication. There's a couple scenes that are the perfect Oscar-bait scenes. But it seems the spotlight is being put on Steven Yeun since Youn Yuh-jung is already a lock. Steven Yeun, though campaigned in lead, feels a little more supporting, but that doesn't take away from his incredible performance. This is by far my favorite of his. His optimism of a better life throughout for sure gives the feel-good effect. He puts so much work into farming and trying to keep the family together that it's complicated for us as well. You can't choose a side. All we can do is hope for the best in the end.Technically, this is a beautiful film. The cinematography is pretty to look at. There's all these nature shots that take you into the life of the farm. The production of the 80s aesthetic is great. Even without being told that it's the 80s at any point (I believe), you can just tell, especially with the house and costumes as subtle as they can be. By far, my favorite aesthetic is Emile Mosseri's score. This is some of the best we've heard all year. Everything about it is so beautiful. Mosseri has this distinct style that I don't know how to describe. All I can say is it's unique where you haven't heard anything like it. Minari has a beautiful aesthetic across the board. It's extremely close to a perfect score, but I wanted a little more from it at a couple moments. This sort of goes back to the simplistic approach. But I just adore this film. I laughed, I cried, I felt good, I felt bad. Most importantly, I felt emotional and attached to the point that I didn't want it to end. By the way, the ending is phenomenal. I urge everyone to see Minari to experience the beauty of film. This is the best film of the year."
11,A portrayal of an immigrant family trying to realize American dream in the farmland of Arkansas. The acting is so authentic that I feel like I am an invisible observer watch a family in the home. The dramatic events at the end moved my to tears.
12,"Lee Isaac Chung floored me with this intimate, commanding, almost Shakespearean story. His service and dedication to all his characters' storylines was masterful, woven with love and levity. This movie will steal your heart if you let it. So, what are you waiting for?"
13,"I can't understand the bad and average views. This movie was perfection, from the acting to the directing to the natural flowing narrative. Honestly probably my favourite movie from this year and would have loved for it to get best picture. It was perfect from beginning to end; and the ending could not have gone better. As a family trying to start over after their misgivings and mistakes, I honestly cant see how better this could have ended. Just Bliss a24 you've done it again."
14,Fantastic movie. Incredible cast dynamic. I love the beauty and how it's tells a truly American tale.
15,"After the great hidden gems I found at the Birmingham (online) Cine-Excess film festival last year,I decided to pre-order a number of screenings/streams taking place for the first major UK movie festival of 2021: The Glasgow Film Festival. leading to me seeing the opening film.View on the film:Returning to fiction film making, the impact co-directing the documentary I Have Seen My Last Born (2015) had on writer/director Lee Isaac Chung is one that comes prominently across, via planting the camera at the child's height of David,with Chung & cinematographer of the TV show Stranger Things, Lachlan Milne having it look upwards when David confronts the disapproval of the family,for his misbehaviour.Opening the gates to the new plot of land the family own, Chung takes inspiration from the Western genre,with beautifully composed shots of the bright skyline, lighting the fresh green foods Jacob and Paul plant under the roasting sun.Displaying the tension in the roots of the family, Chung holds back from the big emotional close-up, to instead eye distorted side views,bringing out a raw, intimate atmosphere to listening in on the family arguments.Inspired by his childhood growing up on a small farm in rural Lincoln, Arkansas, the screenplay by Chung brilliantly grows the coming of age David experiences, with the push-pull struggle of the family (an outstanding ensemble cast of Alan S. Kim,Yeri Han,Steven Yeun,Youn Yuh-jung and Will Patton) trying to remain together,whilst attempting to grow The American Dream.Igniting an emotional punch of a ending, Chung puts out the flames of disagreement between David, his aunt Soon-ja and husband/wife David & Monica with a poetic final scene, where from out of the flames they have battled through, the family discover green shoots."
16,"...it was way past my bed time and I played it in back ground while having my late night beverage. Yet, it finished it one go.Go for it."
17,"A movie about a family there is korean based family living kn california and husband decided to shift to village side for doing agricukture..but his wife not interested about that idea..then he face lot of struggles in agriculture and maintain his family...
Good reality movie about a passion of one man and agriculture difficulties..
And talk about relations between grandmother and grandson..
Then sacrifice between husband and wife..!!Must watch movie..!!Worth for oscar..!"
18,"I went into this not knowing anything about the story with an open mind. What a treat! This is one of the BEST films I've seen in a long time. It is tender, loving, heartbreaking and tough. It's got elements of all of those things and many more. The subtitles didn't bother me at all. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed them as they added another layer of authenticity to an already phenomenal tale. You will laugh but bring a few tissues as you will need them. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie today. And spread the word!"
19,"Minari tells the story of a Korean family namely, Jacob(Steven Yeun), Monica(Yeri Han), their son David(Alan S. Kim) & their daughter Anne(Noel Cho). They start a farm in Arkansas, in the 1980s.Minari is an awe-inspiring film. Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung has given us a movie filled with comedic & emotional moments, that leaves you feeling happy, in the end. This film is about the everlasting love of family. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Steven Yeun is fantastic as Jacob. Yeri Han is brilliant as Monica. Yeun & Han share this effortless chemistry, in all their scenes together. Alan S. Kim is adorable & outstanding as David. Noel Cho is phenomenal as Anne. Both Kim & Cho have knocked it out of the park, in their acting debut. Yuh-Jung Youn is spectacular as Soonja. The supporting cast is superb. Minari deserves all the awards love coming its way. One of my favorite Oscar nominees of 2021. Watch it, as soon as possible!"
20,"My dad is from mexico and my mom is a latina from California, her side of the family is whitewashed and when I was 10, my grandma from my dads side came to visit us and we were so mean to her. She died before I was able to appreciate her and our culture."
21,"My Review- Minari-
My Rating 10/10
The Minari film posters tell us ""This is the movie we need right now "" and I'm inclined to agree with that statement.""
"" Minari ""is unusual these days in that it follows a narrative right through to the end simply and without pretentious cleverness. In a world of movies when many skip back and forth in time with multiple story lines and characters it's refreshing to just really get acquainted with a family especially a family from another culture.Minari was filmed in just 25 days in Tulsa Oklahoma at an inconceivable production cost of $2 million dollars which it had already more than doubled.
The acting of the entire cast is superb I've already awarded The Best Supporting Actress Oscar to Youn Yuh-Jung who plays Soon Jah the Grandma who's Grandson David ( Alan S. Kim ) who is also superb in his role as Jacob's son . He tells Soon Jag that ""You're not a real Grandma.because you can't bake cookies and tell stories.
Youn Yuh-Jung proves him wrong and introduces David and the audience to Minari or Korean Celery or Water Dropwort that the film gets its title and heart from.No spoilers or plot lines from me except just the outlineYearning to own a small patch of land and be more than a chicken sexer, the ambitious paterfamilias, Jacob Yi, relocates his Korean-American family, sceptical wife, Monica, and their children, David and Anne, from California to 1980s rural Arkansas, to start afresh and capture the elusive American Dream.
With this film, Steven Yeun who is cast as Jacob a Korean man with a dream becomes the first Asian-American and first person of East Asian descent to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
There are so many great acting performances and Best Films nominated this year that I really couldn't predict who or what film will win but Minari , it's star it's co Star and Director Lee Isaac Chung certainly are all worthy contenders.
Some members of The Minari cast aren't nominated but also give exceptional performances Yeri Han as Monica ,Jacob's wife who wonders how the hell did her family end up in Hillbilly Country and also Will Patton as Paul a kind hearted but crazy
Cross carrying Evangelist that works hard on Jacob's farm encouraging him not to give up and give in on his dream.
Lee Isaac Chung originally wanted to write an adaptation of My Antonia by Willa Cather but found out that Cather did not wish for people to make film adaptations of her works so he decided and inspired to make a film about his own rural upbringing.
Both Writer and director of Monaro Lee Isaac Chung wrote in the Los Angeles Times about how he came to write Minari. He was about to start teaching full time for the sake of his family and thought he would write one final script in the few months before the job began. Desperate for inspiration, he closed his eyes at his regular coffee shop and the words ""Willa Cather"" rang in his ears. Looking her up, he saw she was a novelist who wrote about life on the Great Plains, and he fell in love with her novel My Antonia. He learned that Cather initially imitated famous novelists who wrote about city life, thinking her own rural experience wouldn't be accepted. She felt unfulfilled and then wrote successful rural stories that were true to herself. She said, ""Life began for me, when I ceased to admire and began to remember."" Reflecting on this, Chung said, ""I wondered if the voice was leading me to these words, so that I would begin to trust in my own. As an exercise, I devoted an afternoon to writing my memories of childhood. I remembered our family's arrival at a single-wide trailer on an Ozark meadow and my mother's shock at learning that this would be our new home. I recalled the smell of freshly plowed soil and the way the color of it pleased my father. I remembered the creek where I threw rocks at snakes while my grandmother planted a Korean vegetable that grew without effort. With each memory, I saw my life anew, as though the clouds had shifted over a field I had seen every day. After writing 80 memories, I sketched a narrative arc with themes about family, failure and rebirth. That's how I got the idea to write 'Minari'; it began for me, when I ceased to admire and began to remember.""
Lee Isaac Chung receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Director, along with Chloé Zhao for Nomadland (2020), marks the first time two directors of East Asian descent have been nominated in the category in the history of The Academy Awards.
Go see Minari but see it in a Cinema it's an intimate film with subtitles and needs to be seen on the Giant Screen rather than reading the subtitles off a television screen and missing the impact of the film."
22,"It's unfortunate Golden Globes had to categorize this film as ""foreign"". In my opinion, this is the most American film of the year. Where else can you find an immigrant family leaving their homeland behind, starting from nothing, try to build a farm, learning how to assimilate with the locals while still loving their own culture? Without such a family, we'd not have the strong multicultural society that defines us today.I like this film for the fact that it focuses on hope and resolution rather than struggles and despairs. This is what the real life is all about. Unfortunate things do happen but most of the times good things will happen to people who put their heart and soul into their work. It's the journey that defines a person, not the end result and I think this movie has captured the essence well."
23,Absolutely stunning. Moved me to tears multiple times. Steven Yeun!!
24,A family drama on reel looking so much real..A wonderful feeling while watching this movie.
25,"I created an IMDB account just to have a chance to write a review and share how much I loved that movie. It was beyond beautiful, I loved everything about it. Apparently this is isn't the case for everybody, which is fair. But definitely give it a try. This is hands down one of my favourite movies of all time."
26,"Soonja is the best character of the year so far like it is incredible how moving she is, how sweet and charming, and her ability to be relatable and recognizable despite proximity to immigration being our only common link and even that to varying degrees is powerful. My friend texted me and said that her mom told her this movie was basically her life on film which was so amazing to hear so for that Lee Isaac Chung and this film's screenplay deserve much more props and I am expecting Oscar noms and wins best believe. Emile Mosseri is my favorite composer now confirmed after Kajillionaire and now this there is absolutely no competition I am streaming that man on Spotify so hard he's bout to be my number one artist next to like Lady Gaga and now Olivia Rodrigo for her Driver's License song (how 2021 of me). Sledgehammer of an emotional ending I got to clear my tear ducts mighty well and I maintain anyone whether an immigrant themselves or first generation can find someone to relate to and see multiple people they know in this film which is a testament to the craft of the story and the underlying experience we can bond over."
27,"There is so much we need to learn from others, this is the biggest teaching from this movie. We don't know what people went through and the power of the family to lean on.Despite the evident axial issues presented in the film, there are universal values that can taught through this movie."
28,"Minari, a semi-autobiographical and earnest portrayal of an immigrant family, written and directed by Isaac Lee Chung, tugs at viewers' heartstrings and is surely a 2021 must-watch. The incredible starring cast, intricate storyline, poignant background score and perfectly punctuated cinematography all combine to make this Korean and English feature a beautiful masterpiece.The name of the film, Minari, is another name for Korean watercress, which is key to the plotline. When the story begins the Yi family had immigrated to the U.S. from Korea years ago; Jacob (Steven Yeun) and Monica (Ye-Ri Han), parents to David (Alan Kim) and Anne (Noel Cho), are chicken sexers by profession. The family moves from California to the Ozarks for new opportunities. Specifically, Arkansas, where they are greeted by their new yet run-down mobile home and by Paul, an eccentric evangelist. As they settle into their new home, problems in the family begin to set in. In the name of bringing back a bit of the family spirit, Monica invites her mother, Soonja (Yuh-Jung Youn), to come and stay with them. The foul-mouthed, cards-playing, yet adorable halmeoni (grandma in Korean) arrives and totally shakes things up, bonding with the grandkids over growing minari, playing cards, and watching wrestling. When tragedy strikes, though, the family is put through a resilience test like never before.Lee Isaac Chung took inspiration from his own childhood growing up on his parents' plot of land to create this film; it's personal, and it shows. This film is a ""the summer when everything changed"" type of story . Steven Yeun is, as always, masterful in encapsulating the minimal emotions and laconic speech of his character. Veteran Korean actress Yuh-Jung Youn is my other favorite in this film; her character's feisty-yet-lovable grandma persona truly fits. She's an unwavering icon of the South Korean film industry and her experience shows. Also, the cinematography team for Minari, as well as the editing team, have worked meticulously to create a seamless viewing experience that accentuates emotions, waits for just long enough to switch scenes, and adds the perfect level of drama to every scene. Minari as a whole makes it feel like you're peeking into the Yi family's life-it's breathtaking.The Sundance Award-winning film Minari is a priceless portrait of resilience within family, of sticking together even through the hardest times, and of enjoying the smallest things in life. Minari has some mild language and there are certain religious elements that parents should watch out for.I give Minari 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults.

29,"Minari is an absolute must-see. Charming, beautiful, and moving."
30,Minari is not a 10/10 movie tbh. But the timing of this cannot be better so i gave it a 10. Steven Yeun has always been my favorites and i already predicted that one day he would receive a movie like this. I mean... the oscars is nothing compared to what he was given... If the stone is a wealth gap representation of parasite then minari ( water-needed plant ) is a family wealth dream symbol of Minari!
31,I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can not recommend it more the acting is amazing and it's been quite a while since a film has taken my breath away like this one . The score fits so perfectly with the tone of the film and the pacing really allows you to get to know and understand the characters .
32,"I am speechless. I'm going back and watching all the best picture nominees and this movie was amazing. The acting, writing, directing, sound design all of it. This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'd give it an 11/10 if I could."
33,I absolutely love bed watching this film. I'm a #KDrama fanatic so it's a natural fit. But it's much more than i even expected. It's a beautiful film and the performances are exquisite. And! What a sound track! Beautiful! It's so well worth the watch. A gem for sure.
34,"This will be a film talked about for a long time. The story is very powerful portrayed by fantastic acting. I could tell this story was written from the heart and was made with lots of passion. It was very easy to connect with many of the characters.No major negatives, which means everybody needs to see this film."
35,"Minari, directed by Lee Isaac Chung- a film that reflects his own story set in the rural backdrop of Arkansas. Needless to say, it is one of the best films I've watched in long which speaks about the very essence of what it's like to be around people that will never betray you regardless of circumstances that changes, of how hope never gets 'cancelled', to keep the faith and a gentle reminder that you got to live life one step at a time.It is truly heart-warming and its rather a story with many elements that can be found relatable universally. How a once considered catalyst (David's grandmother) was in fact a blessing in disguise is absolutely brilliant to notice. But she changes the dynamic of the house when she join forces with her grandkids.'The American Dream' and a phase where many immigrants were recruited all over the world to take up jobs that others scorned has also been spoken about through this film. Also, brilliant and strong acting by each and everyone in the film- Steven Yeun, Han Ye-Ri, Youn Yuh-Jung, Alan Kim, Noel Cho, Will Patton etc.In short, a beautiful screenplay and vision of the director and a heart- touching soundtrack which conveys every emotions that cannot be expressed in words. A must watch film, hands down. Really looking forward to seeing more from the person I cherish to call an inspiration- Lee Isaac Chung."
36,"This Probably Won't Leave My Head Easily As It Was An Emotional And Beautiful Korean-American Story That Truly Resonates With You. This Is Probably My First Movie Of 2021 In Other Labguage. Its Beautiful Movie, Thanks Brad Pitt For Producing Such A Masterpiece. Its Is Just A Falling Star From Sky And You Wish That It Can Real. Voila"
37,"What I liked
1. Real-life immigrant story
2. Emphasis on little details and struggles
3. Complex topics captured in wholesome manner.
5. Brilliant acting
6. Southern country setting.As Grandma said: Minari is wonderful, grows like weeds on curbs, eaten by both rich and poor, and supremely healthy. The movie felt just like that. This screenplay is a deeply intimate portrayal of an immigrant story. It has a slow country flow- which keeps the viewers soothingly involved as if we are part of the family.It touches important topics: Emotional struggles of immigrant couples, complicated relationship between 1st generation (children) and their grandparents, a family falling apart because of financial concerns, spending time with friends to solve problems at home, ignorance of white folks, Asian mindset of always-""be practical and useful"", and many more subtle details. It weaves all these details and presents us with a wholesome, sad yet hopeful story about the life of immigrants.American dream is so glorified, but this vulnerable story gives us a big reality check. As Asian myself, I could relate a lot. Thank you! :)"
38,Excellent American family movie. Love love love.Reaches to the heart of humanity.
39,"This is one that touched me in the theater but really got me on the way home. The characters were compelling and the story was riveting, but it was really after the film was over that it hit me. You will realize what family and commitment are really all about. Excellent film."
40,"MINARI is a beautifully written film, full of images and symbols that accrue layers of meaning as the story unfolds. It is sensitively directed, lovingly photographed, compassionate and compelling. The acting ensemble is flawless. There really is nothing to dislike.
More, please."
41,Tears after tears every 30 minutes. I'm amazed at the way care is displayed in all aspects of life.Sharing of a room and wanting to leave because of what you caused but they come back to still want you back home.Tears weren't held back.
42,"Loved basically everything about this film: cast, story, music, and cinematography were stellar, just absolutely top notch. We ventured out to our local theater solely to see this movie, and so happy we did: tears, suspense, tons of heart, near-and-far culture, along with a healthy dose of laugh-out-loud moments. Oscar material for sure, or there's no justice in this world. (Brad Pitt involved as producer which only makes me think even more highly of his work and ability.)"
43,"5/2/22 (First viewing writing this on a plane)
It's cliché to write but from the start of the film, the cinematography grabs you by the eyeballs and draws you in. The natural lighting and use of nature are used beautifully from the beginning and I believe it must be foreshadowing as I begin to watch Minari without knowing much about the premise. As I continued to watch, it's all about nature growth and the earth. All of the shots were stunning from beginning to the ending scene.The costuming could be easily overlooked. It's definitely a huge asset to the film. The choices play a huge part to the color palette of the film as well as the character's standing in life and their unique personalities, especially Grandmother and David.The relationship between David and his grandmother is magical. It's a back and forth of rawness. A true love/hate. But, really a love that a boy of his age cannot express nor understand coming from an elder. It continues to evolve throughout the film. It's one of the best things to witness. At one point in the film, David whispers to his sleeping grandmother, ""This is all your fault."" He holds nothing back. He's a typical child of his age. Or perhaps, Grandmother, herself is the greatest thing about Minari.Grandmother reminds me of my own maw-maw, except she's not an alcoholic. She curses, she teaches the children games that they shouldn't know at their age, she is atypical, she brings an unruly sense of humor to the film, she dresses inappropriately and she brutally honest. When she arrives at the Yi's farm, there is a sign of life! We get some comic relief. She's a prankster as well as a wise woman who does want the best for her family. She's also a reminder to Jacob and Monica that they are a couple who are in love. They always have been and have had a dream to make it in America.Jacob and Monica have a strained relationship and that's not a secret from the start. They've been through hell together and here they are, starting over again, as a Korean family in a small town in Arkansas. The love is there but they bicker a lot and the kids witness much of this. Their current state of affairs is what Jacob has chosen for the family. He wants to start his own farm with his own land where lots of the town folk aren't very welcoming to people like them.I enjoyed Paul. I haven't read any other reviews to know what has been said about anything but I must include him. He's very religious and is a salt of the earth Arkansas man. He is helpful to Jacob and the entire Yi family. His beliefs may be off the wall to most but he doesn't try to push them on anyone. He's harmless. Paul just wants to help them and his convictions are strong about Jesus and how he feels he can be of service to the business that Jacob is trying to cultivate. He adds a splash of color that needn't be overlooked.I don't want to give spoilers away about this movie. Minari is a plant that can be used for MANY things. Grandmother plays a huge role in this seed with her relationship with her grandson. All good things come to families who stick together through thick and thin. Sometimes you have to go through hell to get a little slice of Heaven on earth. Those who persevere through the roughest patches of life and find the good in people around them will discover that life is about love, and moreover, that living is about doing things as a ""we"" not going at it alone. Thanks, Lee Isaac Chung, for this magnificent gift of a film!"

45,"Simple story of a modest family attempting to conquer the so-called ""American Dream"". It's not all rainbows and butterflies and this film clearly shows that.
For me, at leat Han Ye-Ri should win the oscar for best actress on a supporting role. The scene where she was crying has to be one of the best. Fantastic film and above all BRILLIANT PERFORMANCES."
46,"Very relatable characters and story is what makes this film great. Audience can connect a lot with what is happening on screen and become emotionally engaged with it. The writing was great, perfect mix of comedic lines and dramatic arguments. The story is simple but this film looks more in depths of many elements to the family's choice of moving to a new place to start a farm."
47,"What a movie, you can find the relatedness and balance in every role in this family. If you see close enough, you can see each role have different intention in term of being ''part'' of the family.Great act from all of the cast. Paul make some spark that for me tbh i doesn't really get it what his role for. but somehow it make the story in the great portion of conflict.i love the cinematography, the set was perfect too. The story concept wasn't really new either, but it feel really fresh."
48,"Minari is a delightful film about a Korean family moving to Arkansas to start a farm. The characters are the standout of this film with amazing performances from Steven Yeun, Alan S. Kim and Yuh-Jung Youn in particular.As the film goes on the family encounter many different problems from the wife not sharing the husbands dream of living on a farm, all the way to racism and the children not fitting in at church. Even though a lot of the film is serious, there are also many funny scenes often between Alan S. Kim's character and the Grandma played by Yuh-Jung Youn.As well as the slow, but captivating story, the film also looks great showing off the beautiful American countryside that this family has moved into."
49,A beautifully constructed drama . You feel for the family . As an asian most of scenes are found to be much relatable . A junction of cultures . The settling in .

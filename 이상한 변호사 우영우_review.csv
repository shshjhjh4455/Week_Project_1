0,"With only a few episodes left I feel I can safely assess this series as a 10. The writing is sharp, the actors extremely credible and the corny touches that might feel forced in any other show are pulled off with aplomb here. We wait for the eponymous character's hair to fly back, a scene of a whale or dolphin appears as if we're seeing into her head and BAM she has pieced together the most salient facts of a case that no one else could have and, inevitably, wins the case. What could hav been cheesy is so moving because we developed such an overwhelming empathy for her character. Is it a completely honest portrayal of someone ""on the spectrum?"" As a licensed mental health professional there are many moments where I thought ""No..she wouldn't be smiling or expressing emotion the way she does"" but overall they stay true to what someone with autism might be like. It's called a spectrum after all. The point is despite minor flaws this is the most positive portrayal of someone on the spectrum I've ever seen and I hope it helps people understand the challenges these humans face everyday - even when you have an astounding IQ of 164. I say human and not people because too often society treats these people as if they were sub-human. Sadly, these prejudices cross country and cultural divides.ENOUGH PRATTLE. The most important thing is it's extremely ENTERTAINING.. it proves you don't need sex & violence to reach a mass audience EVEN WHEN YOU MAKE AMERICANS READ SUBTITLES!"
1,"The actress playing Woo Young-Woo is remarkable. She shines on screen. The others are very good, but it wouldn't be as fun to watch if it wasn't for her."
2,"I included a review of this unconventional, highly creative, profoundly wise, soul-igniting, deeply heartfelt, transformative, Consciousness expanding, and overall amazing K-drama within a post I created today.And I fully trust that it's just one of many signs from the Universe that humanity is waking up as Souls, and tuning into the already existing and powerful merge of the Divine Masculine & Divine Feminine energies within ALL of us & all around us (interconnected Life within this world & beyond).The title of this post is, ""Hopeless to Clarity: Orcas, Lemuria, Jumping Spider & Major Opportunities,"" and the following is an excerpt (note: I usually don't write reviews until I've completed experiencing something, but this is how I intuitively FEEL now):As part of this particular series (or phase) of Divine Synchronicity, I saw orcas show up 3 times within the past few days (in this physical reality), along with a magenta, jumping spider (in dream state), and a swarm of crickets plus 1 cricket (in this physical reality) prior to that, all interconnected puzzle pieces revealing the BIGGER picture, like the rest of Life within this world and beyond.Recently, I've been drawn to watching a certain Korean drama series (that I watch with discernment) about an intriguing topic due to personal experiences from the past---3 autistic people showing up in my life, a repeating pattern that's highly beneficial to notice, recognize, acknowledge, embrace, and integrate within WHOLE self (physical self)/Self (Divine Self within/aka Higher Self/Source/Universe/Spirit & Soul/Goddess & God/etc.).In a nutshell, this show is about an amazing, autistic adult attorney who is different from the typical lawyer, since she's very Heart-centered, has loving intentions, is AUTHENTIC/WHOLE/PURE, is transparently honest, and has a child-like, innocent, and curious free spirit.And despite her having a ""disability"" according to this world's society, often being extremely logical and analytical, unable to recognize social cues (though she's willing to learn and grow), and other ways of not being ""normal,"" she is a Creative Genius who strives to Be and do her best in Life to contribute to herself and interconnected humanity.And she has a deep passion, loyalty, and unconditional love for whales, and other cetaceans (to include orcas)---who I trust to be symbolic of her inner guidance/Heart/intuition/inner-knowing/inner-wisdom/insights/true feelings/gut feeling/other love-based gifts (to include psychic abilities), and animal spirit guides.Any even though she's a fictional character, I found myself FEELING super uplifted and happy to experience her Full Presence---as well as other Heart-centered characters--especially during a brief timeframe where I completely lost hope for humans (to include my physical self).And I have no doubt that this fictional character MIRRORED to me Shadow aspects of my Spirit & Soul within that I deeply love, but didn't give enough credit to in the past, due to believing that these aspects (whether Golden positive or negative) were mostly about so-called others from outer world (though they were MIRRORING inner world aspects all this time, to varying degrees, & continue to do so).I also have NO DOUBT that the orca spirit guide, which is also known to assist us in returning back home---not physical home, but I trust Earth/Galactic/Universal Soul Family Home---showed up in my life 3 times recently (3 being a major, sacred number) in Divine perfect timing & order, when I started to believe that even my spiritual family no longer cared.But when I start to have hope and care (as unconditional love for self/others)---even with the tiny faith of a mustard seed, like the name of the preschool I briefly worked at from fall of 2012 to spring of 2013---then outer world automatically MIRRORS to me this True Love.And as I'm typing this, I'm deeply moved to tears.On August 3rd and 6th of 2018, I had two, vivid dreams of baby orcas that I realized---while doing some dream work---were connected to ancient Lemuria.[...]"
3,"This was almost perfect! Twenty Five Twenty One was right below this as the best two KDRAMAs released in 2022 and even though i would almost watch anything with Kim Tae-Ri, Park Eun-Bin continues to surprise me with outstanding performances. These two are real actresses, not just the dolled up Korean women placed ahead of them because they look like models. What a performance and i think they can get away with one more season but please stop after second season. I enjoyed Yoon-Kyeong Ha (Su-Yeon), especially how she supported Attorney Woo throughout. All supporting cast was on the mark, even the mean attorney who tried to turn nice at the end, he played his part very well. When Su-Yeon cried or had a sad or happy part you felt it so either she is super great at acting or it's her real heart. I would guess somewhere in the middle but the guy that gets her in real life will be smiling every day. I intend to watch her in the future.American television or streaming services, this is one of the many quality Korean productions. Netflix is smart in outsourcing these programs because Americans would screw them up. Why is our television so screwed up and can't produce anything close to this quality? Someone please tell me!!"
4,"It is very rare for me to review a series before finishing it, but this was so darn delightful that I could not stop myself sharing the good news. After 3 episodes I wrote that if you are not watching this you are missing out. Also that Eun-bin Park is simply wonderful as the autistic attorney at the centre of this drama, coping so movingly with the challenges she faces.Having now watched the whole series my opinion has not changed. This is a joy to watch. All the usual elements of good K drama are here: fine acting, well drawn characters, believable relationships, deft plotting. I could go on: K dramas do so many things well.But the absolute clincher is the performance of Eun-bin Park. She makes us believe in her character's difficulties. But she also makes us believe in her ability to find a path through that does not contradict her autism. You are on her side the whole series through. She managed to convey a character that struggled with emotions but also gave us those emotions. Remarkable. Utterly believable.I am no expert on autism. I have read reviews here from those with experience of the condition both decrying and lauding the accuracy of the portrayal. Perhaps another reviewer got it right when he/she said that the condition is a spectrum, so those with experience can find that it varies considerably."
5,"I've been a fan of attorney movies and series for a short time, this is one my favorite one alongside Better Call Saul for now. It does a great job explaining to us westerners some of the korean laws and juridical environment.Some autistic people did find themselves identified with Woo and some others didn't. I personally did and I think the representation here is fantastic because it's not just Woo but some other characters that we see throughout the series that have this mental condition and they make it clear that autism is a spectrum.One of my favorite bits of the series was her romance with Jun-ho. It's so well constructed that I have set up my expectations to find someone like him!"
6,"Very entertaining , acting is superb esp with attorney woo she really acts like an autistic person the series is one of the best tv series ever made ..very very nice with touching family values , if you are a career mom, or mother with autistic daughter or son this is also a great series for them..you will always root for attorney wooo.. wehoever made this series is godsend bec he/she was able to establish that you will root for her...tons of different cases and different topics , very educational as well esp if you want to take up law esp you have an idea how democracy works in korea.. no gun violence unlike in the states lol."
7,"Not sure what's better the Autism theme or the acting by the main lead, she is just so cute and funny in her delivering of this character, we will see how this plays out but so far its fantastic.With 8 episodes in have to say this is the best most enjoyable KD ive seen to date. This makes good KD look average at best.Only two hours left and a lot to sew up this should have a great finish, come on writers dont blow it now.Good new 2nd season announced,If there was ever a KD series that warranted 20 episodes it's this one but we only get 16."
8,"Studio Ghibli in real life! Whomever may know what that means... And if you don't, it means it's a must watch. A heartwarming day-to-day journey about a wonderful Attorney. Which says a lot, because I Loathe attorneys. Simply a beautiful person trying to find her way in society, her loves... And her triumphs. That's all I have to say."
9,"Without question, this is one of the best series Netflix has even shown! Wonderful writing and acting- just superb. I thought listening to it in Korean and having to read the subtitles would annoy me, but I was so absorbed that I quickly adjusted.The story of a brilliant but autistic lawyer doesn't sound very interesting, but the story lines, the interaction among the characters, and sweet Woo Young Woo herself is so heart-warming and touching.As a side note, whoever did the outfits for the characters nailed it - beautiful, professional clothes throughout.Please, please give us more seasons of this outstanding series!!"
10,"Extraordinary Attorney Woo takes a bit of getting to....maybe five minutes. And then you're hooked!With charming, likeable, interesting characters and a highly original story line, this is absolutely wonderful!Fantastic acting and writing; the main actress is unbelievably talented!If you don't watch, you are missing out!!!"
11,The main actress is amazing with all her actions and words. I know Autism through friends. Love the way this is put together very well and how the stories collaborate her life into her work and her thinking. The cinema photography is amazing as well. Love this show ans how it shows what the Adults mentally deal with it as well. Very moving and heart warming show! I imagine she gets best actress.
12,"TLDR: great Law show with high production AND two twists: set in Korea, main character is autistic. Also: truly heart warming stuff for the ages.I've seen a few of different crime dramas over the years - I love a Law show that delves deep into the letter of the Law over each case whilst still bearing in mind the ""politics"" of attorneys, prosecutors, but last AND not least, the morality of everything involved.This show in the first episode brings it all together INCLUDING a twist I've never seen before: the main character is autistic. I'm no expert in autism, but so far the actor has had an astounding performance whilst the pilot still establishes the history, the premise, features a good first case and introduces interesting characters and hints at past relationships between some.It was a very strong first episode with flavours of positive energy towards everything in this situation, despite how harsh IRL situations analogous to this could expectably follow.Last but not least, the extraordinary performance by the main actress is nothing short of that (true to the title) and also seeing such a good show produced and portrayed outside the US is also very nice. Nothing wrong about the US, to be clear, but as a Portuguese, I know there's a wide world out there, and seeing the Korean flavour in this is refreshing.PS: after watching all of it, and as a 38y old who has watched so many different shows, I feel it's unavoidable that this is the absolute best. All the production elements are excellent but the characters and the performances from the actors make this a down to earth heart-punching love letter.PPS: not just refreshing - some things here and there resonated for me to the way things happen or happened in my hometown - that familiar feeling across immensely distant cultures over the centuries can only mean one thing: we are all humans and we relate."
13,"The lead did a fantastic job with all the nuances and the supporting cast was damn good, too. Only minus is the dialect moves so fast the subtitles sometimes can't keep up. Still a ten."
14,The acting and concept are fabulous. You just have a grin on your face throughout. It makes you look at the world about quite differently. The entire cast is marvelous.
15,"Whoever this actor is she deserves an Oscar or it's equivilent, if she has Autism then she is outstanding if she doesn't then what a brilliant potrayal of someone on the spectrum. I normally don't watch programmes etc with subtitles but i can't stop watching this."
16,This is a great example how TV dramas should be made. I was hooked to the show with a couple of episodes. The director and the writer are very smart because they are not overdoing things and still getting things greatly done. The lead actress is extraordinarily talented for sure! I didn't know her before this show and now she is my favorite actress! Well done!
17,"Yes, the music is as saccharine as in many Korean dramas, and yes, the budding romance is only missing plush toys in the background... get over it. This is glorious, life-affirming stuff. Woo is beautifully acted and directed with flair. It is laugh-out-loud funny and has you rooting for the eponymous lead from the first moment as she copes with her personal challenges. The depiction of a high function autistic is authentic and not glossed-over. One recalls Rainman, where Hoffman played an HFA/savant who was less able to cope with modern society. You may have also watch The Good Doctor in which a similar character blazes his own trail in the medical profession, but without charm. Neither of those is a patch on Woo and it is down to the performance of Park Eun-Bin, a performance that will make you watch everything else she does."
18,"This is a great series . The South Koreans did it again , I will not be surprised if Americans get a version of this a few years from now. It's absolutely brilliant . I am in love with the Main actress , i became an instant fan of hers. If you know what's good for you . Watch this beautiful series. You'll learn a few things ."
19,"As the name tells, it is indeed an extraordinary web series. Story and background score. It has a base story which keeps on revolving in all the episodes but at the same time every episode has a different story but at the end it will attached to that base story. Hats off to the writer and screen play and the artists who did not rushed but held the base story which actually makes this series an extraordinary one.Holding onto your loved ones. Standing on what is right and following your passion are beautifully portayed.Actings are top notch. This is my first south korean web series. From now on I am going start south korean web series.Highly recommended must watch."
20,"Talented veteran actress Park Eunbin wonderfully leads this uplifting legal drama that focuses on humanity and promotes the acceptance of those that are different than us. Every life is precious and important even if unusual is its message. The production value is very high with wonderful cinematography, editing, CG inclusions, musical accompaniment, etc. What makes the show really special is Park Eunbin's sincerity and lovely acting coupled with the wonderfully written script by Moon Jiwon. The cast chemistry is also quite good. Highly recommended. One of the best shows I've seen in the last decade."
21,"The lead actress deserves all the awards. My goodness! This is scripted excellence with a great ensemble cast.It's refreshing to watch a Kdrama that's serious, fun and multidimensional."
22,"Korean dramas know how to assemble great actors for the wonderful entertainment. This 'Extraordinary Attorney Woö' on NetFlix is right up there with other 10 rating shows from KDRAMA. (Crash Landing on You, Our Blues, Hometown Cha Cha Cha, Vincenzo, Squid Game, Start-Up, King Dom, Hi Bye Mama!, Mad for Each Other, Mr. Sunshine, My Sassy Girl and many other KDRAMAS and KMOVIES). I hope episode 5 thru 16 will be as good as first four episodes.So far each episode represented different cases for attorney Woö to solve them. If you like comedy, heart warming, romance and mild violence. If this show does great thru all episodes, hopefully there be Season 2. This show is a must for you! Don't pay no mind to one user rated a 1. Enjoy it!ThaiGuy2504."
23,"I saw the last chapter now... everything that I wrote below is the understatement of the century... the best series ever the best chapter ever... I never saw anything similar... Most likely will never see.There is towards the last 15 minutes a conversation which stats with loving of a cat... the writer of this series deserves 10000000 academy awards... I saw it 5 times... still do not believe someone in the world was so sensitivitie and smart to write it... wawoooooo 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏It is such a shame that so few people see this series. Most likely (actually 100% sure) because it is a Korean series and the language is not English but a Korean!!!!!' Whar a shame!!!!!This is one the best series ever. In the same league as Breaking Bad, Sherlock, Chernovele... anyone not giving it a chance... simply would have been regretting it go ever...A masterpiece!A unique story that is so touching and authentic that we never saw before.Than there is the actor... she deserves 100000 Oscars prizes!! She is so unbelievable... you fall in love with her after 5 seconds...Then there is the message: being different is not being inferior... far from it.Then there are the stories - yes, not all of them are perfect, or 100% realistic... but still they are so touching and interesting and beautiful...Yes, the culture is different, the acting seems sometimes ""too much""... but this is so negligible...An amazing series... so petty that so few non-korean see it..."
24,"I don't give 10s very often if ever. I absolutely loved this show! Wonderful characters! Park Eun Bin as WYW was a joy to watch. You really want to spend time with these people. Even the shady ones. Never quite knew what was going to happen. I'm glad there was a different court drama each episode and loved the beginning set-ups. Classic yes, but done well. Long, Loving, Quiet shots that you don't expect in a series and the result is emotion you won't forget. And I loved the ending of season one. Looks like there is a season two and I'm happy. I only hope they can live up to the beauty and wonder of this incredible first round."
25,"This series is spectacular, I truly loved every second of it.The amazing story of an autistic woman and her different and difficult upbringing and how everything can be overcome when you put all your might to it.I loved how others tried to bring her down saying why should he live a difficult life and she described her life as beautiful because it was her own, even with difficulties in it.I absolutely enjoyed the amount of values shown here, that affects not only Korean society but its present everywhere, opening up to taboos like disabilities, sexism, being morally political in our lives and even animal rights and exploitation! ( the scenes of the various species of sea animals swimming in the sea or the air are just so beautiful to watch you will be delighted)There's also a lot of very interesting legal cases that will not always go as you expect but they will show you the reality of things having always two sides, that they are not black and white.I love the different kind of characters and how they develop when they keep experiencing all kinds of feelings and emotions.Very lovely drama, watch it, you won't regret it."
26,"I'm becoming a master at subtitles. I stumbled on this wonderful series and decided to give it 20 minutes. Well, second episode, I realized I was hooked. Everything about it is wonderful, the actors are brilliant, photography is beautiful and the writing is great. It reminds me of another series that I loved, (not comparing) Eli Stone. Anyway, I'm hooked and can't wait for the next episode."
27,"I don't usually write movie reviews, but I have to write them here, so that many people out there watch this masterpiece show.Extraordinary Attorney Woo, as the title suggests, Extraordinary. Every aspect of this film is truly extraordinary. This is the only TV series out of the many Korean TV series that have been aired, which makes it hard for me to forget them and switch to another TV series. So I've summarized what I love about this show.First, The main theme. About ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). I know about this very little, and I learned a lot through this series. A theme that is rarely raised by various tv series from any country. Coupled with the story about the trial with the first autistic lawyer in the Republic of Korea. So different, unique, but inspiring and heartwarming at the same time. This will make people realize that Autism people are human and want to be loved and cared for. Thank you very much to the director and writer for bringing up this story.Second, The Acting. I want to take my hat off to Park Eun Bin (as Woo Young Woo), the level of her acting is on par with the Oscars. I was once a volunteer at an orphanage for children with autism. Gestures, expressions, gazes, body language, language structure, which are acted out are 100% exactly the same as what I've ever seen. I think this is her best acting and best performance during her career as an actress. I also want to appreciate Kang Tae Oh (as Lee Jun Ho), his acting is able to express a deep love for Woo Young Woo, sincerely without being made up. The expressions and gazes shown are truly mesmerizing and every word that comes out is very sweet. This is very rare to find in real life, LOL. Also with Kang Ki Young (as Jung Myeong Seok), wonderful acting and performances with his own story. I really hope they get an award, but hopefully Hollywood will recognize them. Since this show is a tv series, hopefully there will be nominations from the Golden Globes / Emmys.Third, The Visual Effects. I remember Coldplay's music video for Up & Up, the visuals for the music video are amazing and eye-catching. Lots of flying whales and other objects that make us imagine higher. As soon as I watched this show, I immediately remembered Coldplay, it's very different for a tv series and the visuals are very warm, imaginative, and very smooth. Kudos to South Korea, it's on par with Hollywood.I also like each case that is told in each different episode. A lot of the story takes place in real life, and I love the unique way Woo Young Woo and law firm Hanbada solve each case. I also like Woo Young Woo's circle of friends and life who want to befriend, accept, and protect Woo Young Woo at all costs, hopefully with this series, many people will realize that Autism people need to be loved.Every time I watch a TV series, no matter how good the story is, I never give a standing ovation, but only this show I unconsciously give a standing ovation while crying. To anyone of you reading this review, PLEASE WATCH this beautiful tv series."
28,I adore this series! Superb acting imo. Attorney Woo is absolutely adorable. I very much look forward to the weekly episodes. I don't think I've seen anything American that is similar.
29,"It is sad that the world is not more accepting of those with mental or physical handicaps. Given a chance, we find that such beings are more than capable. Everyone can contribute to the world, no matter how big or small.If you're like many other people who've seen this beloved series, you'll find yourself immediately enamored by Attorney Woo Young Woo...no matter how it's flipped, it reads the same! And no matter how much you try to look at Woo in a different way, she's still her charming, cute, and beautiful self!We all need a Woo Young Woo in our lives. Such people are often devoid of egotistical traits. There is no animosity or hatred behind their words. And when they love, they love completely. How many people in the world can claim this? We often look at people in the world like Woo Young Woo as having problems. And yet, I daresay, perhaps WE are the ones who should be more like her! Such is the purity of innocence. To have the essence and wonderment of a child. And why are children so wonderful? Because they're like sponges who are free of shame and guilt-such traits are learned behaviors that are sadly instilled in them by parents, society, culture, religion, etc. Woo Young Woo is like being an eternal child, and that is not a bad thing! It's something we should all aspire to be.Like very few autistic people, Woo Young Woo would be classified as a savant. Someone with incredible mental abilities to remember pretty much anything and everything. Such a skill makes Woo Young Woo an amazing asset as an attorney, despite her lack of ability to read people and understand various emotions. Sudden emotional outbursts tend to frighten her, and she's not immediately comfortable in foreign environments. She also has an aversion to being physically touched. But don't let these things fool you since Woo Young Woo has more charm than most people can begin to dream about.Eun Bin Park gives a tremendous performance as Woo Young Woo. The only other characters I've seen that match hers were autistic performances in ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"" and ""Move To Heaven"" (two more incredible Korean dramas if you're looking for something!). Eun Bin Park will have you laughing, smiling, and occasionally tearing up with her delightful performance. She may well have given us one of the cutest characters I've ever seen. And yet, she also shows us the absolute brilliance of Woo Young Woo as an attorney. Yes, we're talking about someone along the lines of a Perry Mason. But what makes her truly remarkable is her integrity; her unwillingness to compromise her values in doing what is right. How many attorneys can claim that?! Not very many, I'd wager.And, of course, because of Woo Young Woo's innocence, she also brings with it a childlike naivety which makes her vulnerable to those who would try to take advantage or mistreat her. It can be a bit painful sometimes to watch those scenes, as all you want to do is be like Jun-Ho and do your utmost to protect her.Woo Young Woo describes herself once as a narwhal living among beluga whales. She knows she's a bit peculiar to most people, but she not only learns to adapt but to accept herself as she is. I would actually go even further and say she's like a gold nugget among lumps of coal. She's far more precious and special than even she can comprehend or realize. And part of the charm of the show is watching those who doubted and even abused her, begin to soften and realize how precious she really is.Another beautiful aspect of the show is the simple, and yet beautiful romance between Woo Young Woo and Jun-Ho. And the reason why it is so incredibly unique is because Jun-Ho fully accepts Woo Young Woo as she is. He never asks her to change or be anything other than who she is. In short, this is one of the rare depictions of unconditional love that many people search for, and yet very seldom find.Extraordinary Attorney Woo is a true delight. It's also light drama in case you're searching for something that isn't too heavy. And the court cases are always very intriguing to watch as we wait and see what magic Woo Young Woo is about to pull. I've already heard that a second Season will be made. And well, I never get tired of Woo Young Woo's love and talk of whales. I definitely want another season of this charming and delightful show!"
30,"I don't watch Korean dramas. I don't watch much of anything anymore. I started this up because of the ""autistic lawyer"" twist thinking it sounded like a clever premise and because I have known autistic people. Wow, I'm hooked.I'm not good at reviews. I never do them. But just give it a chance and you'll love it, I'm sure."
31,"I've watched shows and read articles on autism. I don't know anyone personally with autism and I'm no expert by any means, but how this show portrays ASD is real but respectful. I fell in love with the main character as soon as the 5-year old Woo Young Woo spoke for the first time. I don't watch much TV shows and I'm not big on K-drama, but Extraordinary Attorney Woo has me hooked. I only started watching this show two days ago and I'm already on episode 7, and yes I will be watching more episodes tonight. I love this show!!!"
32,"I have read the books, watched the shows and personally have met and worked with autistic people but I can not say she ""nailed"" the depiction of a person with Asperger's. I can say, howerver, that she nailed it for me and in my opinion it is perfect. She did a exceptionally good job of being a male in King's Affection but in this one she could not be more impressive. Perhaps, she is scripted on how to act but she does it perfect. The show is a relatively solid 8/10 with the same scripts, storyline and great actors but Park Eun-bin genius is what makes this amazing. Again, my opinion but Korean actors are just better overall but she is another level."
33,"I loved this show so much. I hope there is a Season 2 forthcoming. I highly recommend. The characters and storyline were great. The actors were superb. The main character conveyed her role well, and there is something to be learned from it. It was easy to watch, with a bit of real life drama mixed in. I loved that it was based in Korea. It was different and entertaining, and I could not stop watching! I also appreciated the way her character had real life scenarios to move through. All of the characters were great though, and had struggles of their own. I may have to watch again! Please more shows of this caliber!"
34,"Firstly, the story is the predictable idiot savant story. So forget the destination, because the journey to get there is sheer delight.The viewer is taken into the customs of Korea, into realistic problems of aging couples, the justice system, being on a new job, and the autistic person who seems to be oblivious to menace, but then at times will just shut down, holding her head in her arms, unable to cope.The acting is first rate, I can't say the dialog is wonderful because I don't speak Korean, but the subtitles are spot-on.The autism isn't so much a focus as a dramatic tool in telling a story. WYW understands that she is an adult, but she relates to her father as a child, and has a child-like fascination with whales. Her character is essentially Pinocchio... or maybe a humanoid robot like Arisa.Dramatically, WYW presents as an almost comical robot, though highly intelligent and watchable. The comedy, aside from one extended ""gurgling stomach"" scene, is smart. The characters are human, sensitive, and honorable, which makes for pleasant watching.The artistry of this series is also stunning. My goodness, it felt like Heaven seeing WYW in a wedding dress."
35,"Eun-bin Park...outstanding actor and her portrayal Attorney Woo is OSCAR worthy. I don't know if Korea has an equivalent but she deserves the award. I try to quickly read the subtitles, catch the actor's facial expression and keep up with the story line. THE BEST Korean series I've seen in a long while. Not to be missed."
36,I enjoyed it so much great acting by the main characters. A part from episode 2 its realy great to extent it left me sad in the last episode that i wont watch that series again.
37,"Brilliant acting by young woo , brilliantly cast and storyline10/10.This show makes you happy and we keep waiting for the next episodeI have watched all the seasonNow waiting for 2nd seasonAbsolutely brilliant."
38,"I absolutely love this story. The episodes are insightful, warm and funny. Autism is presented so honestly and real. The main actress is incredible. I love the character development of those around her.The other women are presented as intelligent and educated and accepted for their credentials."
39,Fascinating to watch the thought process. Well written and beautifully scored. Woo Young Woo is engaging and lawyers in the firm are at once in awe and frustrated.
40,"I walked in to this series completely blind: And . . . It's awesome. It's a very well produced show in general and shines far beyond its fellow K-drama genre.Especially the lead actress, Ms. Park Eun-Bin, demonstrates an incredibly masterful level of acting as an absolutely adorable protagonist that suffers from the spectrum. I simply can't take my eyes off of her every move in this show.What amazes me is the attention to detail to certain vehicles for storytelling (e.g. The protagonist's obsession about whales). Out of all possible subjects for obsessions, it's definitely a really weird one.Without any spoilers, the whole whale thing could easily serve as a mere whimsical scene cutter just to bring out laughs.But as any viewer who've seen this show might have thought once or twice: ""BUT ... seriously, WHY whales?"" Later in the show, we get that answer; and upon discovery, I personally gasped: ""oh wow! THAT's why :) NICE.""It's very difficult to find something ""engaging"" to watch lately.But this show does a spectacular job in doing so. I will even dare say ... should I say it? Ahh why not : I think it's way better than Squid Game. So much better."
41,"I was a bit skeptical to watch this show when I read the actress wasn't autistic, but she and the entire show portray ASD realistically and thoughtfully. I cannot tell you how much I have enjoyed this show. Its premise is unique among all TV shows, not just Korean. And the best K drama I have watched in a while (maybe forever?) because of how the characters and script are written. The actors are all phenomenal and only elevate this show's premise and bring it to life even more. Not to mention, the show is hilarious and I have found myself laughing aloud and relaying scenes because they're actually gold. Do yourself a favor and watch this show already! I'm always bracing myself for the overdone, cliche themes you see in K dramas, but this show was the biggest breath of fresh air. Hoping for many, many episodes and seasons to come!"
42,"I had no clue what I was expecting, when I clicked on the show. From the first few minutes I was slowly drawn into the show, and by the end of the first episode, I was hooked. What an absolutely beautiful show."
43,"I just watched the final episode... wow... this show did everything right!! If you're looking for a feel good K-drama with romance/comedy/excitement then this is your show!! I loved everything about Woo Young Woo, what an amazing job done by Park Eun-Bin.I really feel like she grew a lot from the moment she started working at Hanbada.Park Eun-Bin deserves every award this season! I can't imagine having to memorize all the stuff about whales AND the law! HahaAnd Kang Tae-Oh... his character: DREAMY!!! I just couldn't stop swooning, the writers did a really great job!I just really loved the whole cast!! All the cases were interesting too. I'm thrilled about a season 2, can't wait!! I hope that we can see more of Young Woo & Junho... I would like to see them meet her father together. I really missed an introduction this season.I hated Kwon Min-woo in the first 12 episodes... but I really liked the way he grew as a person by the end of the season. All thanks to the lovely Choi Su-Yeon.Please watch this show, you will not regret it!"
44,"Totally captivated by this wonderful show! The lead, Park Eun-bin, is pitch-perfect. You will fall in love with the entire cast as every single actor is worthy of their own stories. I've never had the opportunity to visit South Korea, although I did live in Okinawa for several years. I am enjoying this look into South Korean life with it's marvelous scenery. I'm hoping whoever is responsible for this show is writing more episodes right now!!!"
45,"The actors in this series are just amazing. The chemistry, the bonds that are built as the series progress, the internal struggles some face, and so much more, is just amazing! It is so interesting how the writers/producers blend autism, romance, Korean culture, the law, and so much other day-to-day we all experience together in such a beautiful series.Park Eun Bin (that plays attorney Woo Young Woo) is superb in this role. Every episode leaves you with such a good feeling (caring/uplifting), and one just want to watch the next episode. Her supporting actors are also amazing in bringing the whole series together!If you going to watch this series, I can promise you that you will not be disappointed. I am also writing this review before the final 2 episodes, but I cannot wait to see the final 2 episodes!Hope that the producers and writers plan a season 2!!"
46,"What an incredible show. 10 minutes in and I'm rolling my eyes at what I thought was a generic k-dramedy. 30 minutes in though, I was intrigued. By the end of the episode, I was hooked and in love with Attorney Woo. Little did I expect that the following episodes added just further depth, amusement and moments where I literally had tears running down my face. The acting as at times a bit OTT but that just adds to the charm or this show. I'm fascinated to know where the show will go and have my fingers crossed that it continues to deliver so beautifully."
47,"No joking the best show on Netflix this year.A show that makes you laugh and drop tears within the same episode, relaxes your nerve while making you think.Doing 1-2 points well, you get a good show.I can't say too many shows in history did all of those so well.The plot, the cast, the direction, all executed so well."
48,"Extraordinary Attorney Woo is as good as any show that you will see. I have watched the first 8 episodes and I just absolutely loved everything about this wonderful and magical show. It is joyful, heartbreaking, wonderful, magical, and extraordinary. It is impossible not to love Young Woo-Young. Now. I will patiently wait for the next 8 episodes. :)"
49,"This was my first experience with a Korean television show. The production quality was phenomenal, as was the acting and the writing.This show made me laugh and cry, it was quite beautiful.I don't generally enjoy reading subtitles, but it was absolutely worth getting out of my comfort zone for this.Fantastic. I hope they make another season."
